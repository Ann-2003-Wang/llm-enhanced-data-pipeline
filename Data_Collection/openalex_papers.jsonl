We develop a theory of AI job replacement to address this double-edged impact. The theory specifies four intelligences required for service tasks—mechanical, analytical, intuitive, and empathetic—and lays out the way firms should decide between humans and machines for accomplishing those tasks. AI is developing in a predictable order, with mechanical mostly preceding analytical, analytical mostly preceding intuitive, and intuitive mostly preceding empathetic intelligence. The theory asserts that AI job replacement occurs fundamentally at the task level, rather than the job level, and for “lower” (easier for AI) intelligence tasks first. AI first replaces some of a service job’s tasks, a transition stage seen as augmentation, and then progresses to replace human labor entirely when it has the ability to take over all of a job’s tasks. The progression of AI task replacement from lower to higher intelligences results in predictable shifts over time in the relative importance of the intelligences for service employees. An important implication from our theory is that analytical skills will become less important, as AI takes over more analytical tasks, giving the “softer” intuitive and empathetic skills even more importance for service employees. Eventually, AI will be capable of performing even the intuitive and empathetic tasks, which enables innovative ways of human–machine integration for providing service but also results in a fundamental threat for human employment.", "abstract_source": "openalex", "authors": ["Ming‐Hui Huang", "Roland T.

Artificial intelligence is a field of study and the resulting innovations and developments that have culminated in computers, machines, and other artifacts having human-like intelligence characterized by cognitive abilities, learning, adaptability, and decision-making capabilities. The study ascertained that AI has extensively been adopted and used in education, particularly by education institutions, in different forms. AI initially took the form of computer and computer related technologies, transitioning to web-based and online intelligent education systems, and ultimately with the use of embedded computer systems, together with other technologies, the use of humanoid robots and web-based chatbots to perform instructors' duties and functions independently or with instructors. Using these platforms, instructors have been able to perform different administrative functions, such as reviewing and grading students' assignments more effectively and efficiently, and achieve higher quality in their teaching activities.

The field of artificial intelligence, or AI, attempts to understand intelligent entities. Thus, one reason to study it is to learn more about ourselves. But unlike philosophy and psychology, which are also concerned with AI strives to build intelligent entities as well as understand them. Another reason to study AI is that these constructed intelligent entities are interesting and useful in their own right. AI has produced many significant and impressive products even at this early stage in its development. Although no one can predict the future in detail, it is clear that computers with human-level intelligence (or better) would have a huge impact on our everyday lives and on the future course of civilization. AI addresses one of the ultimate puzzles. How is it possible for a slow, tiny brain{brain}, whether biological or electronic, to perceive, understand, predict, and manipulate a world far larger and more complicated than itself? How do we go about making something with those properties? These are hard questions, but unlike the search for faster-than-light travel or an antigravity device, the researcher in AI has solid evidence that the quest is possible. All the researcher has to do is look in the mirror to see an example of an intelligent system. AI is one of the newest disciplines. It was formally initiated in 1956, when the name was coined, although at that point work had been under way for about five years. Along with modern genetics, it is regularly cited as the ``field I would most like to be in''by scientists in other disciplines. A student in physics might reasonably feel that all the good ideas have already been taken by Galileo, Newton, Einstein, and the rest, and that it takes many years of study before one can contribute new ideas. AI, on the other hand, still has openings for a full-time Einstein. The study of intelligence is also one of the oldest disciplines. For over 2000 years, philosophers have tried to understand how seeing, learning, remembering, and reasoning could, or should, be done. The advent of usable computers in the early 1950s turned the learned but armchair speculation concerning these mental faculties into a real experimental and theoretical discipline. Many felt that the new ``Electronic Super-Brains''had unlimited potential for intelligence. ``Faster Than Einstein''was a typical headline. But as well as providing a vehicle for creating artificially intelligent entities, the computer provides a tool for testing theories of intelligence, and many theories failed to withstand the test--a case of ``out of the armchair, into the fire.''AI has turned out to be more difficult than many at first imagined, and modern ideas are much richer, more subtle, and more interesting as a result. AI currently encompasses a huge variety of subfields, from general-purpose areas such as perception and logical reasoning, to specific tasks such as playing chess, proving mathematical theorems, writing poetry{poetry}, and diagnosing diseases. Often, scientists in other fields move gradually into artificial intelligence, where they find the tools and vocabulary to systematize and automate the intellectual tasks on which they have been working all their lives. Similarly, workers in AI can choose to apply their methods to any area of human intellectual endeavor. In this sense, it is truly a universal field. &lt;/p&gt;", "abstract_source": "openalex", "authors": ["Stuart Russell", "Peter Norvig"], "publish_year": 1995, "venue": "", "citation_count": 1746, "fields_of_study": ["Cognitive science", "Computer science", "Artificial intelligence", "Epistemology", "Psychology", "Data science", "Philosophy", "History", "Pure mathematics", "Archaeology", "Mathematics"], "url": "https://openalex.org/W3021909058"}

Building from not only extant research but also extensive interactions with practice, the authors propose a multidimensional framework for understanding the impact of AI involving intelligence levels, task types, and whether AI is embedded in a robot. Prior research typically addresses a subset of these dimensions; this paper integrates all three into a single framework. Next, the authors propose a research agenda that addresses not only how marketing strategies and customer behaviors will change in the future, but also highlights important policy questions relating to privacy, bias and ethics.

{"source": "openalex", "paper_id": "https://openalex.org/W1514583064", "title": "Encyclopedia of Artificial Intelligence", "abstract": "The inductive learning methodology known as decision trees, concerns the ability to classify objects based on their attributes values, using a tree like structure from which decision rules can be accrued. In this article, a description of decision trees is given, with the main emphasis on their operation in a fuzzy environment. A first reference to decision trees is made in Hunt et al. (1966), who proposed the Concept learning system to construct a decision tree that attempts to minimize the score of classifying chess endgames. The example problem concerning chess offers early evidence supporting the view that decision trees are closely associated with artificial intelligence (AI). It is over ten years later that Quinlan (1979) developed the early work on decision trees, to introduced the Interactive Dichotomizer 3 (ID3). The important feature with their development was the use of an entropy measure to aid the decision tree construction process (using again the chess game as the considered problem). It is ID3, and techniques like it, that defines the hierarchical structure commonly associated with decision trees, see for example the recent theoretical and application studies of Pal and Chakraborty (2001), Bhatt and Gopal (2005) and Armand et al. (2007). Moreover, starting from an identified root node, paths are constructed down to leaf nodes, where the attributes associated with the intermediate nodes are identified through the use of an entropy measure to preferentially gauge the classification certainty down that path. Each path down to a leaf node forms an ‘if .. then ..’ decision rule used to classify the objects. The introduction of fuzzy set theory in Zadeh (1965), offered a general methodology that allows notions of vagueness and imprecision to be considered. Moreover, Zadeh’s work allowed the possibility for previously defined techniques to be considered with a fuzzy environment. It was over ten years later that the area of decision trees benefited from this fuzzy environment opportunity (see Chang and Pavlidis, 1977). Since then there has been a steady stream of research studies that have developed or applied fuzzy decision trees (FDTs) (see recently for example Li et al., 2006 and Wang et al., 2007). The expectations that come with the utilisation of FDTs are succinctly stated by Li et al. (2006, p. 655); “Decision trees based on fuzzy set theory combines the advantages of good comprehensibility of decision trees and the ability of fuzzy representation to deal with inexact and uncertain information.” Chiang and Hsu (2002) highlight that decision trees has been successfully applied to problems in artificial intelligence, pattern recognition and statistics. They go onto outline a positive development the FDTs offer, namely that it is better placed to have an estimate of the degree that an object is associated with each class, often desirable in areas like medical diagnosis (see Quinlan (1987) for the alternative view with respect to crisp decision trees). The remains of this article look in more details at FDTs, including a tutorial example showing the rudiments of how an FDT can be constructed.", "abstract_source": "openalex", "authors": ["Stuart C.

Consumers are reluctant to utilize healthcare provided by AI in real and hypothetical choices, separate and joint evaluations. Consumers are less likely to utilize healthcare (study 1), exhibit lower reservation prices for healthcare (study 2), are less sensitive to differences in provider performance (studies 3A–3C), and derive negative utility if a provider is automated rather than human (study 4). Uniqueness neglect, a concern that AI providers are less able than human providers to account for consumers’ unique characteristics and circumstances, drives consumer resistance to medical AI. Indeed, resistance to medical AI is stronger for consumers who perceive themselves to be more unique (study 5). Uniqueness neglect mediates resistance to medical AI (study 6), and is eliminated when AI provides care (a) that is framed as personalized (study 7), (b) to consumers other than the self (study 8), or (c) that only supports, rather than replaces, a decision made by a human healthcare provider (study 9).

Technically, the problem of explainability is as old as AI itself and classic AI represented comprehensible retraceable approaches. However, their weakness was in dealing with uncertainties of the real world. Through the introduction of probabilistic learning, applications became increasingly successful, but increasingly opaque. Explainable AI deals with the implementation of transparency and traceability of statistical black‐box machine learning methods, particularly deep learning (DL). We argue that there is a need to go beyond explainable AI. To reach a level of explainable medicine we need causability. In the same way that usability encompasses measurements for the quality of use, causability encompasses measurements for the quality of explanations. In this article, we provide some necessary definitions to discriminate between explainability and causability as well as a use‐case of DL interpretation and of human explanation in histopathology.

Driving by this trend, there is an urgent need to push the AI frontiers to the network edge so as to fully unleash the potential of the edge big data. To meet this demand, edge computing, an emerging paradigm that pushes computing tasks and services from the network core to the network edge, has been widely recognized as a promising solution. The resulted new interdiscipline, edge AI or edge intelligence (EI), is beginning to receive a tremendous amount of interest. However, research on EI is still in its infancy stage, and a dedicated venue for exchanging the recent advances of EI is highly desired by both the computer system and AI communities. To this end, we conduct a comprehensive survey of the recent research efforts on EI. Specifically, we first review the background and motivation for AI running at the network edge. We then provide an overview of the overarching architectures, frameworks, and emerging key technologies for deep learning model toward training/inference at the network edge.

Unfortunately, the blackbox nature of the DL is still unresolved, and many machine decisions are still poorly understood.

From its beginnings as a small workshop, UAI has grown to become the leading conference in the field. It is now the primary international forum for presenting new results on the use of principled methods for reasoning under uncertainty within intelligent systems. The scope of UAI is wide, including, but not limited to, representation, automated reasoning, learning, decision making, and knowledge acquisition under uncertainty. This year's conference (UAI 2004) continues the tradition, including contributions that report on advances in these core areas, as well as insights derived from the construction and use of applications involving uncertain reasoning. This volume comprises the papers accepted for presentation at UAI 2004, held at the Banff Park Inn in Banff, Canada, from July 7 through 11, 2004. Papers appearing in this volume were subjected to rigorous review; three Program Committee members (or in some cases, auxiliary reviewers) reviewed each paper under the supervision of an Area Chair, who made recommendations to the Program Chairs. The assignment of Program Committee members to papers was based on their expertise and expressed interests in the papers, with an eye toward coverage of the relevant aspects of each paper. This year a record 253 papers were submitted to UAI, and 76 papers were accepted for plenary or poster presentation at the conference. All accepted papers appear in this volume. We are confident that the proceedings, like past UAI Conference Proceedings, will become an important archival reference for the field.\r\n\r\nBased on the recommendation of the program committee, we selected one paper for the recipient of the Best Paper Award and one as the recipient of the Best Student Paper Award. These awards were given for outstanding technical contributions. We are pleased to present the UAI 2004 Best Paper Award to David McAllester, Michael Collins, and Fernando Pereira for their paper The Case-Factor Complexity of Markov Random Fields and the 2004 Best Student Paper Award to Mathias Drton and Thomas Richardson for their paper Iterative Conditional Fitting for Gaussian Ancestral Graph Models. The runners-up for the Best Student Paper Award were Gal Elidan, Iftach Nachman, and Nir Friedman for their paper Ideal Parent Structure Learning for Continuous Variable Networks.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the presentation of technical papers, we were very pleased to have five distinguished invited speakers: Ed George (University of Pennsylvania), Jon Kleinberg (Cornell University), Lillian Lee (Cornell University), Alon Orlitsky (University of California at San Diego), and Moshe Y.

Cancer offers a unique context for medical decisions given not only its variegated forms with evolution of disease but also the need to take into account the individual condition of patients, their ability to receive treatment, and their responses to treatment. Challenges remain in the accurate detection, characterization, and monitoring of cancers despite improved technologies. Radiographic assessment of disease most commonly relies upon visual evaluations, the interpretations of which may be augmented by advanced computational analyses. In particular, artificial intelligence (AI) promises to make great strides in the qualitative interpretation of cancer imaging by expert clinicians, including volumetric delineation of tumors over time, extrapolation of the tumor genotype and biological course from its radiographic phenotype, prediction of clinical outcome, and assessment of the impact of disease and treatment on adjacent organs. AI may automate processes in the initial interpretation of images and shift the clinical workflow of radiographic detection, management decisions on whether or not to administer an intervention, and subsequent observation to a yet to be envisioned paradigm.

DL in ocular imaging may be used in conjunction with telemedicine as a possible solution to screen, diagnose and monitor major eye diseases for patients in primary care and community settings. Nonetheless, there are also potential challenges with DL application in ophthalmology, including clinical and technical challenges, explainability of the algorithm results, medicolegal issues, and physician and patient acceptance of the AI ‘black-box’ algorithms.

Whereas automation implies that machines take over a human task, augmentation means that humans collaborate closely with machines to perform a task. Taking a normative stance, the three books advise organizations to prioritize augmentation, which they relate to superior performance. Using a more comprehensive paradox theory perspective, we argue that, in the management domain, augmentation cannot be neatly separated from automation. These dual AI applications are interdependent across time and space, creating a paradoxical tension. Overemphasizing either augmentation or automation fuels reinforcing cycles with negative organizational and societal outcomes. However, if organizations adopt a broader perspective comprising both automation and augmentation, they could deal with the tension and achieve complementarities that benefit business and society. Drawing on our insights, we conclude that management scholars need to be involved in research on the use of AI in organizations. We also argue that a substantial change is required in how AI research is currently conducted in order to develop meaningful theory and to provide practice with sound advice.", "abstract_source": "openalex", "authors": ["Sebastian Raisch", "Sebastian Krakowski"], "publish_year": 2021, "venue": "", "citation_count": 1253, "fields_of_study": ["Knowledge management", "Computer science", "Sociology", "Management science", "Management", "Epistemology", "Artificial intelligence", "Business", "Economics", "Engineering", "Social science", "Mathematics", "Philosophy", "Mechanical engineering", "Finance", "Mathematical analysis"], "url": "https://openalex.org/W4247155454"}

This paper reviews the key capabilities of AI to help surgeons understand and critically evaluate new AI applications and to contribute to new developments. Summary Background Data: AI is composed of various subfields that each provide potential solutions to clinical problems. Each of the core subfields of AI reviewed in this piece has also been used in other industries such as the autonomous car, social networks, and deep learning computers. Methods: A review of AI papers across computer science, statistics, and medical sources was conducted to identify key concepts and techniques within AI that are driving innovation across industries, including surgery. Limitations and challenges of working with AI were also reviewed. Results: Four main subfields of AI were defined: (1) machine learning, (2) artificial neural networks, (3) natural language processing, and (4) computer vision. Their current and future applications to surgical practice were introduced, including big data analytics and clinical decision support systems. The implications of AI for surgeons and the role of surgeons in advancing the technology to optimize clinical effectiveness were discussed. Conclusions: Surgeons are well positioned to help integrate AI into modern practice. Surgeons should partner with data scientists to capture data across phases of care and to provide clinical context, for AI has the potential to revolutionize the way surgery is taught and practiced with the promise of a future optimized for the highest quality patient care.", "abstract_source": "openalex", "authors": ["Daniel A.

GMAI models will be capable of carrying out a diverse set of tasks using very little or no task-specific labelled data. Built through self-supervision on large, diverse datasets, GMAI will flexibly interpret different combinations of medical modalities, including data from imaging, electronic health records, laboratory results, genomics, graphs or medical text. Models will in turn produce expressive outputs such as free-text explanations, spoken recommendations or image annotations that demonstrate advanced medical reasoning abilities.

Some challenges of machine ethics are much like many other challenges involved in designing machines. There is nearly universal agreement among modern AI professionals that artificial intelligence falls short of human capabilities in some critical sense, even though AI algorithms have beaten humans in many specific domains such as chess. In creating a superhuman chess player, the human programmers necessarily sacrificed their ability to predict Deep Blue's local, specific game behavior. A different set of ethical issues arises when one can contemplate the possibility that some future AI systems might be candidates for having moral status. One also has moral reasons to treat them in certain ways, and to refrain from treating them in certain other ways.

A subdomain of AI is machine learning (ML), which “learns” intrinsic statistical patterns in data to eventually cast predictions on unseen data. Deep learning is a ML technique using multi-layer mathematical operations for learning and inferring on complex data like imagery. This succinct narrative review describes the application, limitations and possible future of AI-based dental diagnostics, treatment planning, and conduct, for example, image analysis, prediction making, record keeping, as well as dental research and discovery. AI-based applications will streamline care, relieving the dental workforce from laborious routine tasks, increasing health at lower costs for a broader population, and eventually facilitate personalized, predictive, preventive, and participatory dentistry. However, AI solutions have not by large entered routine dental practice, mainly due to 1) limited data availability, accessibility, structure, and comprehensiveness, 2) lacking methodological rigor and standards in their development, 3) and practical questions around the value and usefulness of these solutions, but also ethics and responsibility. Any AI application in dentistry should demonstrate tangible value by, for example, improving access to and quality of care, increasing efficiency and safety of services, empowering and enabling patients, supporting medical research, or increasing sustainability. Individual privacy, rights, and autonomy need to be put front and center; a shift from centralized to distributed/federated learning may address this while improving scalability and robustness. Lastly, trustworthiness into, and generalizability of, dental AI solutions need to be guaranteed; the implementation of continuous human oversight and standards grounded in evidence-based dentistry should be expected. Methods to visualize, interpret, and explain the logic behind AI solutions will contribute (“explainable AI”).

On the other side, the authors build on and integrate sociological and psychological scholarship to examine some of the costs consumers experience in their interactions with AI. In doing so, the authors identify four types of consumer experiences with AI: (1) data capture, (2) classification, (3) delegation, and (4) social. This approach allows the authors to discuss policy and managerial avenues to address the ways in which consumers may fail to experience value in organizations’ investments into AI and to lay out an agenda for future research.", "abstract_source": "openalex", "authors": ["Stefano Puntoni", "Rebecca Walker Reczek", "Markus Giesler", "Simona Botti"], "publish_year": 2020, "venue": "", "citation_count": 823, "fields_of_study": ["Marketing", "Computer science", "Knowledge management", "Sociology", "Business", "Artificial intelligence", "Economics", "Medicine", "Machine learning", "Economic growth", "Pedagogy", "Internal medicine"], "url": "https://openalex.org/W3081261125"}

In recent years, the applications of AIED have been gradually adopted to progress our understanding of students’ learning and enhance learning performance and experience. However, the adoption of AIED has led to increasing ethical risks and concerns regarding several aspects such as personal data and learner autonomy. Despite the recent announcement of guidelines for ethical and trustworthy AIED, the debate revolves around the key principles underpinning ethical AIED. This paper aims to explore whether there is a global consensus on ethical AIED by mapping and analyzing international organizations’ current policies and guidelines. In this paper, we first introduce the opportunities offered by AI in education and potential ethical issues. Then, thematic analysis was conducted to conceptualize and establish a set of ethical principles by examining and synthesizing relevant ethical policies and guidelines for AIED. We discuss each principle and associated implications for relevant educational stakeholders, including students, teachers, technology developers, policymakers, and institutional decision-makers. The proposed set of ethical principles is expected to serve as a framework to inform and guide educational stakeholders in the development and deployment of ethical and trustworthy AIED as well as catalyze future development of related impact studies in the field.", "abstract_source": "openalex", "authors": ["Andy Nguyen", "Ha Ngan Ngo", "Yvonne Hong", "Belle Dang", "Bich‐Phuong Thi Nguyen"], "publish_year": 2022, "venue": "", "citation_count": 800, "fields_of_study": ["Engineering ethics", "Psychology", "Knowledge management", "Public relations", "Political science", "Sociology", "Computer science", "Engineering", "Social psychology", "Social science", "Law", "Civil engineering", "Programming language"], "url": "https://openalex.org/W4304943299"}

The world population is increasing at a very fast rate and with increase in population the need for food increases briskly. Traditional methods used by farmers aren't sufficient enough to serve the increasing demand and so they have to hamper the soil by using harmful pesticides in an intensified manner. This affects the agricultural practice a lot and in the end the land remains barren with no fertility. This paper talks about different automation practices like IOT, Wireless Communications, Machine learning and Artificial Intelligence, Deep learning. There are some areas which are causing the problems to agriculture field like crop diseases, lack of storage management, pesticide control, weed management, lack of irrigation and water management and all this problems can be solved by above mentioned different techniques. Today, there is an urgent need to decipher the issues like use of harmful pesticides, controlled irrigation, control on pollution and effects of environment in agricultural practice. Automation of farming practices has proved to increase the gain from the soil and also has strengthened the soil fertility. This paper surveys the work of many researchers to get a brief overview about the current implementation of automation in agriculture.

Artificial intelligence (AI) assistants could potentially aid in creating answers to patient questions by drafting responses that could be reviewed by clinicians. Objective To evaluate the ability of an AI chatbot assistant (ChatGPT), released in November 2022, to provide quality and empathetic responses to patient questions. Design, Setting, and Participants In this cross-sectional study, a public and nonidentifiable database of questions from a public social media forum (Reddit’s r/AskDocs) was used to randomly draw 195 exchanges from October 2022 where a verified physician responded to a public question. Chatbot responses were generated by entering the original question into a fresh session (without prior questions having been asked in the session) on December 22 and 23, 2022. The original question along with anonymized and randomly ordered physician and chatbot responses were evaluated in triplicate by a team of licensed health care professionals. Evaluators chose “which response was better” and judged both “the quality of information provided” ( very poor , poor , acceptable , good , or very good ) and “the empathy or bedside manner provided” ( not empathetic , slightly empathetic , moderately empathetic , empathetic , and very empathetic ). Mean outcomes were ordered on a 1 to 5 scale and compared between chatbot and physicians. Results Of the 195 questions and responses, evaluators preferred chatbot responses to physician responses in 78.6% (95% CI, 75.0%-81.8%) of the 585 evaluations. Mean (IQR) physician responses were significantly shorter than chatbot responses (52 [17-62] words vs 211 [168-245] words; t = 25.4; P &amp;amp;lt; .001). Chatbot responses were rated of significantly higher quality than physician responses ( t = 13.3; P &amp;amp;lt; .001). The proportion of responses rated as good or very good quality (≥ 4), for instance, was higher for chatbot than physicians (chatbot: 78.5%, 95% CI, 72.3%-84.1%; physicians: 22.1%, 95% CI, 16.4%-28.2%;). This amounted to 3.6 times higher prevalence of good or very good quality responses for the chatbot. Chatbot responses were also rated significantly more empathetic than physician responses ( t = 18.9; P &amp;amp;lt; .001). The proportion of responses rated empathetic or very empathetic (≥4) was higher for chatbot than for physicians (physicians: 4.6%, 95% CI, 2.1%-7.7%; chatbot: 45.1%, 95% CI, 38.5%-51.8%; physicians: 4.6%, 95% CI, 2.1%-7.7%). This amounted to 9.8 times higher prevalence of empathetic or very empathetic responses for the chatbot. Conclusions In this cross-sectional study, a chatbot generated quality and empathetic responses to patient questions posed in an online forum. Further exploration of this technology is warranted in clinical settings, such as using chatbot to draft responses that physicians could then edit. Randomized trials could assess further if using AI assistants might improve responses, lower clinician burnout, and improve patient outcomes.", "abstract_source": "openalex", "authors": ["John W.

Impressive examples of this development can be found in domains such as image classification, sentiment analysis, speech understanding or strategic game playing. However, because of their nested non-linear structure, these highly successful machine learning and artificial intelligence models are usually applied in a black box manner, i.e., no information is provided about what exactly makes them arrive at their predictions. Since this lack of transparency can be a major drawback, e.g., in medical applications, the development of methods for visualizing, explaining and interpreting deep learning models has recently attracted increasing attention. This paper summarizes recent developments in this field and makes a plea for more interpretability in artificial intelligence.

Deep learning algorithms can deal with increasing amounts of data provided by wearables, smartphones, and other mobile monitoring sensors in different areas of medicine. Currently, only very specific settings in clinical practice benefit from the application of artificial intelligence, such as the detection of atrial fibrillation, epilepsy seizures, and hypoglycemia, or the diagnosis of disease based on histopathological examination or medical imaging. The implementation of augmented medicine is long-awaited by patients because it allows for a greater autonomy and a more personalized treatment, however, it is met with resistance from physicians which were not prepared for such an evolution of clinical practice. This phenomenon also creates the need to validate these modern tools with traditional clinical trials, debate the educational upgrade of the medical curriculum in light of digital medicine as well as ethical consideration of the ongoing connected monitoring.

Conflict between humans and machines is seen as inevitable and its outcome all too predictable. In this groundbreaking book, distinguished AI researcher Stuart Russell argues that this scenario can be avoided, but only if we rethink AI from the ground up. Russell begins by exploring the idea of intelligence in humans and in machines. He describes the near-term benefits we can expect, from intelligent personal assistants to vastly accelerated scientific research, and outlines the AI breakthroughs that still have to happen before we reach superhuman AI. He also spells out the ways humans are already finding to misuse AI, from lethal autonomous weapons to viral sabotage. If the predicted breakthroughs occur and superhuman AI emerges, we will have created entities far more powerful than ourselves. How can we ensure they never, ever, have power over us? Russell suggests that we can rebuild AI on a new foundation, according to which machines are designed to be inherently uncertain about the human preferences they are required to satisfy. Such machines would be humble, altruistic, and committed to pursue our objectives, not theirs. This new foundation would allow us to create machines that are provably deferential and provably beneficial. In a 2014 editorial co-authored with Stephen Hawking, Russell wrote, \"Success in creating AI would be the biggest event in human history. Unfortunately, it might also be the last.\" Solving the problem of control over AI is not just possible; it is the key that unlocks a future of unlimited promise\"--", "abstract_source": "openalex", "authors": ["Stuart Russell"], "publish_year": 2019, "venue": "", "citation_count": 790, "fields_of_study": ["Artificial intelligence", "Computer science", "Operations research", "Environmental ethics", "Political science", "Psychology", "Law", "Engineering", "Philosophy", "Neuroscience", "Physics", "Quantum mechanics"], "url": "https://openalex.org/W3034344071"}

The innovations introduced by AI include highly advanced computational methods that mimic the way the human brain works. The application of AI in the transport field is aimed at overcoming the challenges of an increasing travel demand, CO2 emissions, safety concerns, and environmental degradation. In light of the availability of a huge amount of quantitative and qualitative data and AI in this digital age, addressing these concerns in a more efficient and effective fashion has become more plausible. Examples of AI methods that are finding their way to the transport field include Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Genetic algorithms (GA), Simulated Annealing (SA), Artificial Immune system (AIS), Ant Colony Optimiser (ACO) and Bee Colony Optimization (BCO) and Fuzzy Logic Model (FLM) The successful application of AI requires a good understanding of the relationships between AI and data on one hand, and transportation system characteristics and variables on the other hand. Moreover, it is promising for transport authorities to determine the way to use these technologies to create a rapid improvement in relieving congestion, making travel time more reliable to their customers and improve the economics and productivity of their vital assets.

The study explores three main areas: (1) How did ChatGPT answer questions related to science education? (2) What are some ways educators could utilise ChatGPT in their science pedagogy? and (3) How has ChatGPT been utilised in this study, and what are my reflections about its use as a research tool? This exploratory research applies a self-study methodology to investigate the technology. Impressively, ChatGPT’s output often aligned with key themes in the research. However, as it currently stands, ChatGPT runs the risk of positioning itself as the ultimate epistemic authority, where a single truth is assumed without a proper grounding in evidence or presented with sufficient qualifications. Key ethical concerns associated with AI include its potential environmental impact, issues related to content moderation, and the risk of copyright infringement. It is important for educators to model responsible use of ChatGPT, prioritise critical thinking, and be clear about expectations. ChatGPT is likely to be a useful tool for educators designing science units, rubrics, and quizzes. Educators should critically evaluate any AI-generated resource and adapt it to their specific teaching contexts. ChatGPT was used as a research tool for assistance with editing and to experiment with making the research narrative clearer.

In what may be called conventional ad hoc-frame-oriented (AFO) CAI, the data base consists of many \"frames\" of specific pieces of text, questions, and anticipated answers entered in advance by the teacher. By contrast, an information-structure-oriented (ISO) CAI system is based on the utilization of an information network of facts, concepts, and procedures; it can generate text, questions, and corresponding answers. Because an ISO CAI system can also utilize its information network to answer questions formulated by the student, a mixed-initiative dialogue between student and computer is possible with questions and answers from both sides.", "abstract_source": "openalex", "authors": ["Jaime Carbonell"], "publish_year": 1970, "venue": "", "citation_count": 866, "fields_of_study": ["Computer science", "Artificial intelligence", "Multimedia", "Programming language", "Pathology", "Medicine", "Telecommunications", "Mathematics", "Mathematical analysis", "Geometry"], "url": "https://openalex.org/W1984938651"}

It is desirable to develop automatic and accurate detection of COVID-19 using chest CT. Purpose To develop a fully automatic framework to detect COVID-19 using chest CT and evaluate its performance. Materials and Methods In this retrospective and multicenter study, a deep learning model, the COVID-19 detection neural network (COVNet), was developed to extract visual features from volumetric chest CT scans for the detection of COVID-19. CT scans of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and other non-pneumonia abnormalities were included to test the robustness of the model. The datasets were collected from six hospitals between August 2016 and February 2020. Diagnostic performance was assessed with the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, sensitivity, and specificity. Results The collected dataset consisted of 4352 chest CT scans from 3322 patients. The average patient age (±standard deviation) was 49 years ± 15, and there were slightly more men than women (1838 vs 1484, respectively; <i>P</i> = .29). The per-scan sensitivity and specificity for detecting COVID-19 in the independent test set was 90% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 83%, 94%; 114 of 127 scans) and 96% (95% CI: 93%, 98%; 294 of 307 scans), respectively, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.96 (<i>P</i> < .001). The per-scan sensitivity and specificity for detecting CAP in the independent test set was 87% (152 of 175 scans) and 92% (239 of 259 scans), respectively, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.95 (95% CI: 0.93, 0.97). Conclusion A deep learning model can accurately detect coronavirus 2019 and differentiate it from community-acquired pneumonia and other lung conditions. © RSNA, 2020 <i>Online supplemental material is available for this article.</i>", "abstract_source": "openalex", "authors": ["Lin Li", "Lixin Qin", "Zeguo Xu", "Youbing Yin", "Xin Wang", "Bin Kong", "Junjie Bai", "Yi Lu", "Zhenghan Fang", "Qi Song", "Kunlin Cao", "Daliang Liu", "Guisheng Wang", "Qizhong Xu", "Xisheng Fang", "Shiqin Zhang", "Juan Xia", "Jun Xia"], "publish_year": 2020, "venue": "", "citation_count": 1993, "fields_of_study": ["Medicine", "Radiology", "Nuclear medicine", "Internal medicine"], "url": "https://openalex.org/W3011149445"}

In education, AI has begun producing new teaching and learning solutions that are now undergoing testing in different contexts. AI requires advanced infrastructures and an ecosystem of thriving innovators, but what about the urgencies of developing countries? Will they have to wait for the “luxury” of AI? Or should AI be a priority to tackle as soon as possible to reduce the digital and social divide?These are some of the questions guiding this document. In this regard, this urgent discussion should be taken up with a clear picture of what is happening and what can be done. This document gathers examples of how AI has been introduced in education worldwide, particularly in developing countries. It also sows the seeds of debates and discussions in the context of the 2019 Mobile Learning Week and beyond, as part of the multiple ways to accomplish Sustainable Development Goal 4, which targets education. The first section of this document analyses how AI can be used to improve learning outcomes. It presents examples of how AI technology can help education systems use data to improve educational equity and quality in the developing world. The section is divided into two topics that address pedagogical and system-wide solutions:i) AI to promote personalisation and better learning outcomes, exploring how AI can favour access to education, collaborative environments and intelligent tutoring systems to support teachers. We briefly introduce cases from countries such as China, Uruguay, Brazil, South Africa and Kenya as examples experimental solutions conceived from public policies, philanthropic and private organisations. ii) Data analytics in Education Management Information Systems (EMIS). Here we present opportunities for improving a state’s capacity to manage large-scale educational systems by increasing data from schools and learning, presenting cases from United Arab Emirates, Kenya, Bhutan, Kyrgyzstan and Chile.The second section “Preparing learners to thrive in an AI-saturated future” explores the different means by which governments and educational institutions are rethinking and reworking educational programmes to prepare learners for the increasing presence of AI in all aspects of human activity. Based on examples from different contexts, the section is also divided into two main parts: i) “A new curriculum for a digital and AI powered world” elaborates further on the importance of advancing in digital competency frameworks for teachers and students. Some current initiatives are presented such as the “Global Framework to Measure Digital Literacy” and “ICT Competencies and Standards from the Pedagogical Dimension”. The discussion of the curricular dimension is broadened to include new experiences for developing computational thinking in schools with examples from the European Union, United Kingdom, Estonia, Argentina, Singapore and Malaysia.ii) The second part is more focused on strengthening AI capacities through post-basic education and training. How can each country prepare the conditions for an AI-powered world? Here we present some of the most advanced cases from developed countries who are generating comprehensive plans to tackle this question, namely France, South Korea and China. We also present some cases from the technical and vocational education and training sector and some opportunities from non-formal and informal learning scenarios.The last section addresses the challenges and policy implications that should be part of the global and local conversations regarding the possibilities and risks of introducing AI in education and preparing students for an AI-powered context. Six challenges are presented: The first challenge lies in developing a comprehensive view of public policy on AI for sustainable development. The complexity of the technological conditions needed to advance in this field require the alignment of multiple factors and institutions. Public policies have to work in partnership at international and national levels to create an ecosystem of AI that serves sustainable development. The second challenge is to ensure inclusion and equity for AI in education. The least developed countries are at risk of suffering new technological, economic and social divides with the development of AI. Some main obstacles such as basic technological infrastructure must be faced to establish the basic conditions for implementing new strategies that take advantage of AI to improve learning.The third challenge is to prepare teachers for an AI-powered education while preparing AI to understand education, though this must nevertheless be a two-way road: teachers must learn new digital skills to use AI in a pedagogical and meaningful way and AI developers must learn how teachers work and create solutions that are sustainable in real-life environments. The fourth challenge is to develop quality and inclusive data systems. If we are headed towards the datafication of education, the quality of data should be our chief concern. It ́s essential to develop state capabilities to improve data collection and systematisation. AI developments should be an opportunity to increase the importance of data in educational system management.The fifth challenge is to make research on AI in education significant. While it can be reasonably expected that research on AI in education will increase in the coming years, it is nevertheless worth recalling the difficulties that the education sector has had in taking stock of educational research in a significant way both for practice and policy-making.The sixth challenge deals with ethics and transparency in data collection, use and dissemination. AI opens many ethical concerns regarding access to education system, recommendations to individual students, personal data concentration, liability, impact on work, data privacy and ownership of data feeding algorithms. AI regulation will thus require public discussion on ethics, accountability, transparency and security.The document ends with an open invitation to create new discussions around the uses, possibilities and risks of AI in education for sustainable development.", "abstract_source": "openalex", "authors": ["Francesc Pedró", "Miguel Subosa", "Axel Rivas", "Paula Valverde"], "publish_year": 2019, "venue": "", "citation_count": 904, "fields_of_study": ["Engineering ethics", "Business", "Political science", "Engineering", "Law"], "url": "https://openalex.org/W2942193471"}

We must constantly separate trustworthy and required information from the massive amount of data we encounter each day. Through mathematical theories, models, and experimental computations, Artificial Intelligence with Uncertainty explores the uncertainties of knowledge and intelligence that occur during the cognitive processes of human beings. The authors focus on the importance of natural language-the carrier of knowledge and intelligence-for artificial intelligence (AI) study. This book develops a framework that shows how uncertainty in AI expands and generalizes traditional AI. It describes the cloud model, its uncertainties of randomness and fuzziness, and the correlation between them. The book also centers on other physical methods for data mining, such as the data field and knowledge discovery state space. In addition, it presents an inverted pendulum example to discuss reasoning and control with uncertain knowledge as well as provides a cognitive physics model to visualize human thinking with hierarchy.

NGs endow smart textiles with mechanical energy harvesting and multifunctional self‐powered sensing capabilities, while textiles provide a versatile flexible design carrier and extensive wearable application platform for their development. However, due to the lack of an effective interactive platform and communication channel between researchers specializing in NGs and those good at textiles, it is rather difficult to achieve fiber/fabric‐based NGs with both excellent electrical output properties and outstanding textile‐related performances. To this end, a critical review is presented on the current state of the arts of wearable fiber/fabric‐based piezoelectric nanogenerators and triboelectric nanogenerators with respect to basic classifications, material selections, fabrication techniques, structural designs, and working principles, as well as potential applications. Furthermore, the potential difficulties and tough challenges that can impede their large‐scale commercial applications are summarized and discussed.

For Ryan, the theory of possible worlds provides a more nuanced way of discussing the commonplace notion of a fictional world, while artificial intelligence contributes to narratology and the theory of fiction directly via its researches into the cognitive processes of texts and automatic story generation. Although Ryan applies exotic theories to the study of narrative and fiction, her book maintains a solid basis in literary theory and makes the formal models developed by AI researchers accessible to the student of literature. The first part of the book seeks a more sophisticated application of the theory of possible worlds to the definition of fictionality. While fiction is a mode of travel into textual space, narrative is a journey within the confines of this space. The second part introduces the idea of a semantic domain consisting of a plurality of alternate possible worlds. This notion is developed into a theory of narrative conflict, which leads to an account of the forward movement of plot.

Considering the existing literature on XAI, this paper argues that XAI in education has commonalities with the broader use of AI but also has distinctive needs. Accordingly, we first present a framework, referred to as XAI-ED, that considers six key aspects in relation to explainability for studying, designing and developing educational AI tools. These key aspects focus on the stakeholders, benefits, approaches for presenting explanations, widely used classes of AI models, human-centred designs of the AI interfaces and potential pitfalls of providing explanations within education.

The respective underlying fields of basic research-quantum information versus machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI)-have their own specific questions and challenges, which have hitherto been investigated largely independently. However, in a growing body of recent work, researchers have been probing the question of the extent to which these fields can indeed learn and benefit from each other. Quantum ML explores the interaction between quantum computing and ML, investigating how results and techniques from one field can be used to solve the problems of the other. Recently we have witnessed significant breakthroughs in both directions of influence. For instance, quantum computing is finding a vital application in providing speed-ups for ML problems, critical in our 'big data' world. Conversely, ML already permeates many cutting-edge technologies and may become instrumental in advanced quantum technologies. Aside from quantum speed-up in data analysis, or classical ML optimization used in quantum experiments, quantum enhancements have also been (theoretically) demonstrated for interactive learning tasks, highlighting the potential of quantum-enhanced learning agents. Finally, works exploring the use of AI for the very design of quantum experiments and for performing parts of genuine research autonomously, have reported their first successes. Beyond the topics of mutual enhancement-exploring what ML/AI can do for quantum physics and vice versa-researchers have also broached the fundamental issue of quantum generalizations of learning and AI concepts.

This “decision making” side of innovation is what scholars and practitioners refer to as “design.” Decisions in innovation processes have so far been taken by humans. What happens when they can be substituted by machines? Artificial Intelligence (AI) brings data and algorithms to the core of the innovation processes. What are the implications of this diffusion of AI for our understanding of design and innovation? Is AI just another digital technology that, akin to many others, will not significantly question what we know about design? Or will it create transformations in design that current theoretical frameworks cannot capture? This paper proposes a framework for understanding the design and innovation in the age of AI. We discuss the implications for design and innovation theory. Specifically, we observe that, as creative problem‐solving is significantly conducted by algorithms, human design increasingly becomes an activity of sensemaking , that is, understanding which problems should or could be addressed. This shift in focus calls for the new theories and brings design closer to leadership, which is, inherently, an activity of sensemaking. Our insights are derived from and illustrated with two cases at the frontier of AI—Netflix and Airbnb (complemented with analyses of Microsoft and Tesla)—which point to two directions for the evolution of design and innovation in firms. First, AI enables an organization to overcome many past limitations of human‐intensive design processes, by improving the scalability of the process, broadening its scope across traditional boundaries, and enhancing its ability to learn and adapt on the fly. Second, and maybe more surprising, while removing these limitations, AI also appears to deeply enact several popular design principles . AI thus reinforces the principles of Design Thinking, namely: being people‐centered, abductive, and iterative. In fact, AI enables the creation of solutions that are more highly user centered than human‐based approaches (i.e., to an extreme level of granularity, designed for every single person); that are potentially more creative; and that are continuously updated through learning iterations across the entire product life cycle. In sum, while AI does not undermine the basic principles of design, it profoundly changes the practice of design. Problem‐solving tasks, traditionally carried out by designers, are now automated into learning loops that operate without limitations of volume and speed. The algorithms embedded in these loops think in a radically different way than a designer who handles the complex problems holistically with a systemic perspective. Algorithms instead handle complexity through very simple tasks, which are iterated continuously.

Remarkable advancements in AI technology and machine learning present a transformative opportunity in the drug discovery, formulation, and testing of pharmaceutical dosage forms. By utilizing AI algorithms that analyze extensive biological data, including genomics and proteomics, researchers can identify disease-associated targets and predict their interactions with potential drug candidates. This enables a more efficient and targeted approach to drug discovery, thereby increasing the likelihood of successful drug approvals. Furthermore, AI can contribute to reducing development costs by optimizing research and development processes. Machine learning algorithms assist in experimental design and can predict the pharmacokinetics and toxicity of drug candidates. This capability enables the prioritization and optimization of lead compounds, reducing the need for extensive and costly animal testing. Personalized medicine approaches can be facilitated through AI algorithms that analyze real-world patient data, leading to more effective treatment outcomes and improved patient adherence. This comprehensive review explores the wide-ranging applications of AI in drug discovery, drug delivery dosage form designs, process optimization, testing, and pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) studies.

Discussions on many relevant topics, such as trustworthiness, explainability, and ethics are characterized by implicit anthropocentric and anthropomorphistic conceptions and, for instance, the pursuit of human-like intelligence as the golden standard for Artificial Intelligence. In order to provide more agreement and to substantiate possible future research objectives, this paper presents three notions on the similarities and differences between human- and artificial intelligence: 1) the fundamental constraints of human (and artificial) intelligence, 2) human intelligence as one of many possible forms of general intelligence, and 3) the high potential impact of multiple (integrated) forms of narrow-hybrid AI applications. For the time being, AI systems will have fundamentally different cognitive qualities and abilities than biological systems. For this reason, a most prominent issue is how we can use (and “collaborate” with) these systems as effectively as possible? For what tasks and under what conditions, decisions are safe to leave to AI and when is human judgment required? How can we capitalize on the specific strengths of human- and artificial intelligence? How to deploy AI systems effectively to complement and compensate for the inherent constraints of human cognition (and vice versa)? Should we pursue the development of AI “partners” with human (-level) intelligence or should we focus more at supplementing human limitations? In order to answer these questions, humans working with AI systems in the workplace or in policy making have to develop an adequate mental model of the underlying ‘psychological’ mechanisms of AI. So, in order to obtain well-functioning human-AI systems, Intelligence Awareness in humans should be addressed more vigorously.

We hereby review the rapid responses in the community of medical imaging (empowered by AI) toward COVID-19. For example, AI-empowered image acquisition can significantly help automate the scanning procedure and also reshape the workflow with minimal contact to patients, providing the best protection to the imaging technicians. Also, AI can improve work efficiency by accurate delineation of infections in X-ray and CT images, facilitating subsequent quantification. Moreover, the computer-aided platforms help radiologists make clinical decisions, i.e., for disease diagnosis, tracking, and prognosis. In this review paper, we thus cover the entire pipeline of medical imaging and analysis techniques involved with COVID-19, including image acquisition, segmentation, diagnosis, and follow-up.

While AI and automation can augment the productivity of some workers, they can replace the work done by others and will likely transform almost all occupations at least to some degree. Rising automation is happening in a period of growing economic inequality, raising fears of mass technological unemployment and a renewed call for policy efforts to address the consequences of technological change. In this paper we discuss the barriers that inhibit scientists from measuring the effects of AI and automation on the future of work. These barriers include the lack of high-quality data about the nature of work (e.g., the dynamic requirements of occupations), lack of empirically informed models of key microlevel processes (e.g., skill substitution and human–machine complementarity), and insufficient understanding of how cognitive technologies interact with broader economic dynamics and institutional mechanisms (e.g., urban migration and international trade policy). Overcoming these barriers requires improvements in the longitudinal and spatial resolution of data, as well as refinements to data on workplace skills. These improvements will enable multidisciplinary research to quantitatively monitor and predict the complex evolution of work in tandem with technological progress.

These techniques are now actively being applied in healthcare with many of the health service activities currently being delivered by clinicians and administrators predicted to be taken over by AI in the coming years. However, there has also been exceptional hype about the abilities of AI with a mistaken notion that AI will replace human clinicians altogether. These perspectives are inaccurate, and if a balanced perspective of the limitations and promise of AI is taken, one can gauge which parts of the health system AI can be integrated to make a meaningful impact. The four main areas where AI would have the most influence would be: patient administration, clinical decision support, patient monitoring and healthcare interventions. This health system where AI plays a central role could be termed an AI-enabled or AI-augmented health system.

Many AI technologies end up owned and controlled by private entities. The nature of the implementation of AI could mean such corporations, clinics and public bodies will have a greater than typical role in obtaining, utilizing and protecting patient health information. This raises privacy issues relating to implementation and data security. Main body The first set of concerns includes access, use and control of patient data in private hands. Some recent public–private partnerships for implementing AI have resulted in poor protection of privacy. As such, there have been calls for greater systemic oversight of big data health research. Appropriate safeguards must be in place to maintain privacy and patient agency. Private custodians of data can be impacted by competing goals and should be structurally encouraged to ensure data protection and to deter alternative use thereof. Another set of concerns relates to the external risk of privacy breaches through AI-driven methods. The ability to deidentify or anonymize patient health data may be compromised or even nullified in light of new algorithms that have successfully reidentified such data. This could increase the risk to patient data under private custodianship.

AI is believed to be one of the major drives to change socio-economical lives. In another aspect, AI contributes to the advancement of state-of-the-art technologies in many fields of study, as helpful tools for groundbreaking research. However, the prosperity of AI as we witness today was not established smoothly. During the past decades, AI has struggled through historical stages with several winters. Therefore, at this juncture, to enlighten future development, it is time to discuss the past, present, and have an outlook on AI. In this article, we will discuss from a historical perspective how challenges were faced on the path of revolution of both the AI tools and the AI systems.

First, statistical methods for assessing the discrimination and calibration performances of a diagnostic or predictive model are summarized. Next, the effects of disease manifestation spectrum and disease prevalence on the performance results are explained, followed by a discussion of the difference between evaluating the performance with use of internal and external datasets, the importance of using an adequate external dataset obtained from a well-defined clinical cohort to avoid overestimating the clinical performance as a result of overfitting in high-dimensional or overparameterized classification model and spectrum bias, and the essentials for achieving a more robust clinical evaluation. Finally, the authors review the role of clinical trials and observational outcome studies for ultimate clinical verification of diagnostic or predictive artificial intelligence tools through patient outcomes, beyond performance metrics, and how to design such studies. <sup>©</sup> RSNA, 2018.", "abstract_source": "openalex", "authors": ["Seong Ho Park", "Kyunghwa Han"], "publish_year": 2018, "venue": "", "citation_count": 787, "fields_of_study": ["Medicine", "Artificial intelligence", "Machine learning", "Medical physics", "Computer science", "Pathology"], "url": "https://openalex.org/W2783687327"}

It would have been better to have reviewed my previous work rather than attempt something new, but such was not my custom at that time. I am grateful to ACM for the opportunity to try again. Unfortunately for our science, although perhaps fortunately for this project, the problem of generality in artificial intelligence (AI) is almost as unsolved as ever, although we now have many ideas not available in 1971. This paper relies heavily on such ideas, but it is far from a full 1987 survey of approaches for achieving generality. Ideas are therefore discussed at a length proportional to my familiarity with them rather than according to some objective criterion. It was obvious in 1971 and even in 1958 that AI programs suffered from a lack of generality. It is still obvious; there are many more details. The first gross symptom is that a small addition to the idea of a program often involves a complete rewrite beginning with the data structures. Some progress has been made in modularizing data structures, but small modifications of the search strategies are even less likely to be accomplished without rewriting. Another symptom is no one knows how to make a general database of commonsense knowledge that could be used by any program that needed the knowledge. Along with other information, such a database would contain what a robot would need to know about the effects of moving objects around, what a person can be expected to know about his family, and the facts about buying and selling. This does not depend on whether the knowledge is to be expressed in a logical language or in some other formalism. When we take the logic approach to AI, lack of generality shows up in that the axioms we devise to express commonsense knowledge are too restricted in their applicability for a general commonsense database. In my opinion, getting a language for expressing general commonsense knowledge for inclusion in a general database is the key problem of generality in AI. Here are some ideas for achieving generality proposed both before and after 1971.

Its widespread use has been instrumental in ensuring transparency in the evaluation of new interventions. More recently, there has been a growing recognition that interventions involving artificial intelligence (AI) need to undergo rigorous, prospective evaluation to demonstrate impact on health outcomes. The CONSORT-AI (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials–Artificial Intelligence) extension is a new reporting guideline for clinical trials evaluating interventions with an AI component. It was developed in parallel with its companion statement for clinical trial protocols: SPIRIT-AI (Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials–Artificial Intelligence). Both guidelines were developed through a staged consensus process involving literature review and expert consultation to generate 29 candidate items, which were assessed by an international multi-stakeholder group in a two-stage Delphi survey (103 stakeholders), agreed upon in a two-day consensus meeting (31 stakeholders) and refined through a checklist pilot (34 participants). The CONSORT-AI extension includes 14 new items that were considered sufficiently important for AI interventions that they should be routinely reported in addition to the core CONSORT 2010 items. CONSORT-AI recommends that investigators provide clear descriptions of the AI intervention, including instructions and skills required for use, the setting in which the AI intervention is integrated, the handling of inputs and outputs of the AI intervention, the human–AI interaction and provision of an analysis of error cases. CONSORT-AI will help promote transparency and completeness in reporting clinical trials for AI interventions.

Artificial intelligence (AI) is viewed as amongst the technological advances that will reshape modern societies and their relations. While the design and deployment of systems that continually adapt holds the promise of far-reaching positive change, they simultaneously pose significant risks, especially to already vulnerable peoples. Values and power are central to this discussion. Decolonial theories use historical hindsight to explain patterns of power that shape our intellectual, political, economic, and social world. By embedding a decolonial critical approach within its technical practice, AI communities can develop foresight and tactics that can better align research and technology development with established ethical principles, centring vulnerable peoples who continue to bear the brunt of negative impacts of innovation and scientific progress. We highlight problematic applications that are instances of coloniality, and using a decolonial lens, submit three tactics that can form a decolonial field of artificial intelligence: creating a critical technical practice of AI, seeking reverse tutelage and reverse pedagogies, and the renewal of affective and political communities. The years ahead will usher in a wave of new scientific breakthroughs and technologies driven by AI research, making it incumbent upon AI communities to strengthen the social contract through ethical foresight and the multiplicity of intellectual perspectives available to us, ultimately supporting future technologies that enable greater well-being, with the goal of beneficence and justice for all.", "abstract_source": "openalex", "authors": ["Shakir Mohamed", "Marie-Thérèse Png", "William Isaac"], "publish_year": 2020, "venue": "", "citation_count": 559, "fields_of_study": ["Sociology", "Engineering ethics", "Environmental ethics", "Epistemology", "Political science", "Social science", "Artificial intelligence", "Engineering", "Computer science", "Law", "Philosophy"], "url": "https://openalex.org/W3041968715"}

Identifying the best pathway to personalized and population medicine involves the ability to analyze comprehensive patient information together with broader aspects to monitor and distinguish between sick and relatively healthy people, which will lead to a better understanding of biological indicators that can signal shifts in health. While the complexities of disease at the individual level have made it difficult to utilize healthcare information in clinical decision-making, some of the existing constraints have been greatly minimized by technological advancements. To implement effective precision medicine with enhanced ability to positively impact patient outcomes and provide real-time decision support, it is important to harness the power of electronic health records by integrating disparate data sources and discovering patient-specific patterns of disease progression. Useful analytic tools, technologies, databases, and approaches are required to augment networking and interoperability of clinical, laboratory and public health systems, as well as addressing ethical and social issues related to the privacy and protection of healthcare data with effective balance. Developing multifunctional machine learning platforms for clinical data extraction, aggregation, management and analysis can support clinicians by efficiently stratifying subjects to understand specific scenarios and optimize decision-making. Implementation of artificial intelligence in healthcare is a compelling vision that has the potential in leading to the significant improvements for achieving the goals of providing real-time, better personalized and population medicine at lower costs.

To cultivate healthier crops, manage pests, monitor soil and growing conditions, analyse data for farmers, and enhance other management activities of the food supply chain, the agriculture sector is turning to AI technology. It makes it challenging for farmers to choose the ideal time to plant seeds. AI helps farmers choose the optimum seed for a particular weather scenario. It also offers data on weather forecasts. AI-powered solutions will help farmers produce more with fewer resources, increase crop quality, and hasten product time to reach the market. AI aids in understanding soil qualities. AI helps farmers by suggesting the nutrients they should apply to increase the quality of the soil. AI can help farmers choose the optimal time to plant their seeds. Intelligent equipment can calculate the spacing between seeds and the maximum planting depth. An AI-powered system known as a health monitoring system provides farmers with information on the health of their crops and the nutrients that need to be given to enhance yield quality and quantity. This study identifies and analyses relevant articles on AI for Agriculture. Using AI, farmers can now access advanced data and analytics tools that will foster better farming, improve efficiencies, and reduce waste in biofuel and food production while minimising the negative environmental impacts.

ICML is the annual conference of the International Machine Learning Society (IMLS), and provides a venue for the presentation and discussion of current research in the field of machine learning. These proceedings can also be found online at: http://www.machinelearning.org. This year there were 522 submissions to ICML. There was a very thorough review process, in which each paper was reviewed by three program committee (PC) members. Authors were able to respond to the initial reviews, and the PC members could then modify their reviews based on online discussions and the content of this author response. For the first time this year there were two discussion periods led by the senior program committee (SPC), one just before and one after the submission of author responses. At the end of the second discussion period, the SPC members gave their recommendations and provided a summary review for each of their papers. Also for the first time, authors were asked to submit a list of changes with their final accepted papers, which was checked by the SPCs to ensure that reviewer comments had been addressed. Apart from the length restrictions on papers and the compressed time frame, the review process for ICML resembles that of many journal publications. In total, 150 papers were accepted to ICML this year, including a very small number of papers which were initially conditionally accepted, yielding an overall acceptance rate of 29%. ICML attracts submissions from machine learning researchers around the globe. The 150 accepted papers this year were geographically distributed as follows: 66 papers had a first author from the US, 32 from Europe, 19 from China or Hong Kong, 11 from Canada, 6 from India, 5 each from Australia and Japan, 3 from Israel, and 1 each from Korea, Russia and Taiwan. In addition to the main program of accepted papers, which includes both a talk and poster presentation for each paper, the ICML program included 3 workshops and 8 tutorials on machine learning topics which are currently of broad interest. We were also extremely pleased to have David Heckerman (Microsoft Research), Joshua Tenenbaum (Massachussetts Institute of Technology), and Bernhard Schölkopf (Max Planck Institute for Biological Cybernetics) as the invited speakers this year. Thanks to sponsorship by the Machine Learning Journal, we were able to award a number of outstanding student paper prizes.

The coverage combines breadth and depth, offering necessary background material on such topics as probability, optimization, and linear algebra as well as discussion of recent developments in the field, including conditional random fields, L1 regularization, and deep learning. The book is written in an informal, accessible style, complete with pseudo-code for the most important algorithms. All topics are copiously illustrated with color images and worked examples drawn from such application domains as biology, text processing, computer vision, and robotics. Rather than providing a cookbook of different heuristic methods, the book stresses a principled model-based approach, often using the language of graphical models to specify models in a concise and intuitive way. Almost all the models described have been implemented in a MATLAB software package--PMTK (probabilistic modeling toolkit)--that is freely available online.

Unfortunately, this tuning is often a \"black art\" that requires expert experience, unwritten rules of thumb, or sometimes brute-force search. Much more appealing is the idea of developing automatic approaches which can optimize the performance of a given learning algorithm to the task at hand. In this work, we consider the automatic tuning problem within the framework of Bayesian optimization, in which a learning algorithm's generalization performance is modeled as a sample from a Gaussian process (GP). The tractable posterior distribution induced by the GP leads to efficient use of the information gathered by previous experiments, enabling optimal choices about what parameters to try next. Here we show how the effects of the Gaussian process prior and the associated inference procedure can have a large impact on the success or failure of Bayesian optimization. We show that thoughtful choices can lead to results that exceed expert-level performance in tuning machine learning algorithms. We also describe new algorithms that take into account the variable cost (duration) of learning experiments and that can leverage the presence of multiple cores for parallel experimentation. We show that these proposed algorithms improve on previous automatic procedures and can reach or surpass human expert-level optimization on a diverse set of contemporary algorithms including latent Dirichlet allocation, structured SVMs and convolutional neural networks.", "abstract_source": "openalex", "authors": ["Jasper Snoek", "Hugo Larochelle", "Ryan P.

Very few previous studies have examined this crucial and challenging weather forecasting problem from the machine learning perspective. In this paper, we formulate precipitation nowcasting as a spatiotemporal sequence forecasting problem in which both the input and the prediction target are spatiotemporal sequences. By extending the fully connected LSTM (FC-LSTM) to have convolutional structures in both the input-to-state and state-to-state transitions, we propose the convolutional LSTM (ConvLSTM) and use it to build an end-to-end trainable model for the precipitation nowcasting problem. Experiments show that our ConvLSTM network captures spatiotemporal correlations better and consistently outperforms FC-LSTM and the state-of-the-art operational ROVER algorithm for precipitation nowcasting.", "abstract_source": "openalex", "authors": ["Xingjian Shi", "Zhourong Chen", "Hao Wang", "Dit‐Yan Yeung", "Wai Kin Wong", "Wang‐chun Woo"], "publish_year": 2015, "venue": "", "citation_count": 6603, "fields_of_study": ["Computer science", "Artificial intelligence", "Machine learning", "Algorithm", "Meteorology", "Geography"], "url": "https://openalex.org/W1485009520"}

The large-scale case involves the computational complexity of the underlying optimization algorithm in non-trivial ways.

Computers have now mastered a popular variant of poker, learned the laws of physics from experimental data, and become experts in video games − tasks that would have been deemed impossible not too long ago. In parallel, the number of companies centered on applying complex data analysis to varying industries has exploded, and it is thus unsurprising that some analytic companies are turning attention to problems in health care. The purpose of this review is to explore what problems in medicine might benefit from such learning approaches and use examples from the literature to introduce basic concepts in machine learning. It is important to note that seemingly large enough medical data sets and adequate learning algorithms have been available for many decades, and yet, although there are thousands of papers applying machine learning algorithms to medical data, very few have contributed meaningfully to clinical care. This lack of impact stands in stark contrast to the enormous relevance of machine learning to many other industries.

Multimodal machine learning aims to build models that can process and relate information from multiple modalities. It is a vibrant multi-disciplinary field of increasing importance and with extraordinary potential. Instead of focusing on specific multimodal applications, this paper surveys the recent advances in multimodal machine learning itself and presents them in a common taxonomy.

To perform membership inference against a target model, we make adversarial use of machine learning and train our own inference model to recognize differences in the target model's predictions on the inputs that it trained on versus the inputs that it did not train on. We empirically evaluate our inference techniques on classification models trained by commercial \"machine learning as a service\" providers such as Google and Amazon.

This thesis addresses the problem of feature selection for machine learning through a correlation based approach. The central hypothesis is that good feature sets contain features that are highly correlated with the class, yet uncorrelated with each other. A feature evaluation formula, based on ideas from test theory, provides an operational definition of this hypothesis. CFS (Correlation based Feature Selection) is an algorithm that couples this evaluation formula with an appropriate correlation measure and a heuristic search strategy. CFS was evaluated by experiments on artificial and natural datasets. Three machine learn-ing algorithms were used: C4.5 (a decision tree learner), IB1 (an instance based learner), and naive Bayes. Experiments on artificial datasets showed that CFS quickly identifies and screens irrelevant, redundant, and noisy features, and identifies relevant features as long as their relevance does not strongly depend on other features.

SoilGrids provides global predictions for standard numeric soil properties (organic carbon, bulk density, Cation Exchange Capacity (CEC), pH, soil texture fractions and coarse fragments) at seven standard depths (0, 5, 15, 30, 60, 100 and 200 cm), in addition to predictions of depth to bedrock and distribution of soil classes based on the World Reference Base (WRB) and USDA classification systems (ca. 280 raster layers in total). Predictions were based on ca. 150,000 soil profiles used for training and a stack of 158 remote sensing-based soil covariates (primarily derived from MODIS land products, SRTM DEM derivatives, climatic images and global landform and lithology maps), which were used to fit an ensemble of machine learning methods-random forest and gradient boosting and/or multinomial logistic regression-as implemented in the R packages ranger, xgboost, nnet and caret. The results of 10-fold cross-validation show that the ensemble models explain between 56% (coarse fragments) and 83% (pH) of variation with an overall average of 61%. Improvements in the relative accuracy considering the amount of variation explained, in comparison to the previous version of SoilGrids at 1 km spatial resolution, range from 60 to 230%. Improvements can be attributed to: (1) the use of machine learning instead of linear regression, (2) to considerable investments in preparing finer resolution covariate layers and (3) to insertion of additional soil profiles. Further development of SoilGrids could include refinement of methods to incorporate input uncertainties and derivation of posterior probability distributions (per pixel), and further automation of spatial modeling so that soil maps can be generated for potentially hundreds of soil variables. Another area of future research is the development of methods for multiscale merging of SoilGrids predictions with local and/or national gridded soil products (e.g. up to 50 m spatial resolution) so that increasingly more accurate, complete and consistent global soil information can be produced.

Potential attacks include having malicious content like malware identified as legitimate or controlling vehicle behavior. Yet, all existing adversarial example attacks require knowledge of either the model internals or its training data. We introduce the first practical demonstration of an attacker controlling a remotely hosted DNN with no such knowledge. Indeed, the only capability of our black-box adversary is to observe labels given by the DNN to chosen inputs. Our attack strategy consists in training a local model to substitute for the target DNN, using inputs synthetically generated by an adversary and labeled by the target DNN. We use the local substitute to craft adversarial examples, and find that they are misclassified by the targeted DNN. To perform a real-world and properly-blinded evaluation, we attack a DNN hosted by MetaMind, an online deep learning API. We find that their DNN misclassifies 84.24% of the adversarial examples crafted with our substitute. We demonstrate the general applicability of our strategy to many ML techniques by conducting the same attack against models hosted by Amazon and Google, using logistic regression substitutes. They yield adversarial examples misclassified by Amazon and Google at rates of 96.19% and 88.94%. We also find that this black-box attack strategy is capable of evading defense strategies previously found to make adversarial example crafting harder.", "abstract_source": "openalex", "authors": ["Nicolas Papernot", "Patrick McDaniel", "Ian Goodfellow", "Somesh Jha", "Z.

ICML is an international forum for presentation and discussion of the latest results in the field of machine learning. This year, ICML was held at Carnegie Mellon University, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and was co-located with COLT-2006, the 19th Annual Conference on Computational Learning Theory.Coincidentally, Carnegie Mellon University was also the venue for the first ICML---the First Machine Learning Workshop, which was held in 1980. Instead of proceedings, a book was published (Machine Learning: an Artificial Intelligence Approach, ed. Michalski, Carbonell, and Mitchell, Morgan Kaufman, 1983) containing sixteen research papers, and also a comprehensive of the field of machine learning, as it stood in 1983. This bibliography contained 572 entries.In 2006, no less than 548 papers were submitted to ICML---nearly as many as were in the comprehensive published with the papers from the first ICML. These papers were subjected to a thorough review process. In the first round of reviewing, every paper received three reviews by program committee members. Authors were then given an opportunity to view the first-round reviews and respond to them. Led by a Senior Program Committee member, the reviewers then engaged in a discussion of the paper, leading finally to a decision by the Senior Program Committee member in charge of the paper. Papers could be accepted, rejected, or conditionally accepted; the 36 conditionally accepted papers were subject to an additional final round of review by the Senior Program Committee. Of the 548 submissions, 140 were accepted for publication, an acceptance rate of 25.5%.In addition to the technical talks, ICML-2006 also included seven tutorials and eleven workshops, which were held before and after the conference, respectively. Authors presented their papers both orally and in a poster session, allowing time for detailed discussions with any interested attendees of the conference. Each day of the main conference included an invited talk by a prominent researcher.

AD is a small but established field with applications in areas including computational fluid dynamics, atmospheric sciences, and engineering design optimization. Until very recently, the fields of machine learning and AD have largely been unaware of each other and, in some cases, have independently discovered each other’s results. Despite its relevance, general-purpose AD has been missing from the machine learning toolbox, a situation slowly changing with its ongoing adoption under the names “dynamic computational graphs” and “differentiable programming”. We survey the intersection of AD and machine learning, cover applications where AD has direct relevance, and address the main imple- mentation techniques.

Many successful applications of machine learning exist already, including systems that analyze past sales data to predict customer behavior, optimize robot behavior so that a task can be completed using minimum resources, and extract knowledge from bioinformatics data. Introduction to Machine Learning is a comprehensive textbook on the subject, covering a broad array of topics not usually included in introductory machine learning texts. In order to present a unified treatment of machine learning problems and solutions, it discusses many methods from different fields, including statistics, pattern recognition, neural networks, artificial intelligence, signal processing, control, and data mining. All learning algorithms are explained so that the student can easily move from the equations in the book to a computer program. The text covers such topics as supervised learning, Bayesian decision theory, parametric methods, multivariate methods, multilayer perceptrons, local models, hidden Markov models, assessing and comparing classification algorithms, and reinforcement learning. New to the second edition are chapters on kernel machines, graphical models, and Bayesian estimation; expanded coverage of statistical tests in a chapter on design and analysis of machine learning experiments; case studies available on the Web (with downloadable results for instructors); and many additional exercises. All chapters have been revised and updated. Introduction to Machine Learning can be used by advanced undergraduates and graduate students who have completed courses in computer programming, probability, calculus, and linear algebra.

This ambiguity has made it problematic for machine learning systems to be adopted in sensitive yet critical domains, where their value could be immense, such as healthcare.

It has been reported that one of these aspects is related to class imbalance in which examples in training data belonging to one class heavily outnumber the examples in the other class. In this situation, which is found in real world data describing an infrequent but important event, the learning system may have difficulties to learn the concept related to the minority class. In this work we perform a broad experimental evaluation involving ten methods, three of them proposed by the authors, to deal with the class imbalance problem in thirteen UCI data sets. Our experiments provide evidence that class imbalance does not systematically hinder the performance of learning systems. In fact, the problem seems to be related to learning with too few minority class examples in the presence of other complicating factors, such as class overlapping. Two of our proposed methods deal with these conditions directly, allying a known over-sampling method with data cleaning methods in order to produce better-defined class clusters. Our comparative experiments show that, in general, over-sampling methods provide more accurate results than under-sampling methods considering the area under the ROC curve (AUC). This result seems to contradict results previously published in the literature. Two of our proposed methods, Smote + Tomek and Smote + ENN, presented very good results for data sets with a small number of positive examples. Moreover, Random over-sampling, a very simple over-sampling method, is very competitive to more complex over-sampling methods. Since the over-sampling methods provided very good performance results, we also measured the syntactic complexity of the decision trees induced from over-sampled data. Our results show that these trees are usually more complex then the ones induced from original data. Random over-sampling usually produced the smallest increase in the mean number of induced rules and Smote + ENN the smallest increase in the mean number of conditions per rule, when compared among the investigated over-sampling methods.", "abstract_source": "openalex", "authors": ["Gustavo E.

Although it is a powerful tool that can help in rendering medical diagnoses, it can be misapplied. Machine learning typically begins with the machine learning algorithm system computing the image features that are believed to be of importance in making the prediction or diagnosis of interest. The machine learning algorithm system then identifies the best combination of these image features for classifying the image or computing some metric for the given image region. There are several methods that can be used, each with different strengths and weaknesses. There are open-source versions of most of these machine learning methods that make them easy to try and apply to images. Several metrics for measuring the performance of an algorithm exist; however, one must be aware of the possible associated pitfalls that can result in misleading metrics. More recently, deep learning has started to be used; this method has the benefit that it does not require image feature identification and calculation as a first step; rather, features are identified as part of the learning process. Machine learning has been used in medical imaging and will have a greater influence in the future.

Face recognition algorithms use a large dataset of photos labeled as having a face or not to estimate a function that predicts the presence y of a face from pixels x. This similarity to econometrics raises questions: How do these new empirical tools fit with what we know? As empirical economists, how can we use them? We present a way of thinking about machine learning that gives it its own place in the econometric toolbox. Machine learning not only provides new tools, it solves a different problem. Specifically, machine learning revolves around the problem of prediction, while many economic applications revolve around parameter estimation. So applying machine learning to economics requires finding relevant tasks. Machine learning algorithms are now technically easy to use: you can download convenient packages in R or Python. This also raises the risk that the algorithms are applied naively or their output is misinterpreted. We hope to make them conceptually easier to use by providing a crisper understanding of how these algorithms work, where they excel, and where they can stumble—and thus where they can be most usefully applied.", "abstract_source": "openalex", "authors": ["Sendhil Mullainathan", "Jann Spiess"], "publish_year": 2017, "venue": "", "citation_count": 1708, "fields_of_study": ["Machine learning", "Computer science", "Artificial intelligence", "Mathematics", "Social science", "Statistics", "Programming language", "Operating system", "Sociology"], "url": "https://openalex.org/W2610886376"}

These mechanisms of classification all frequently rely on computational algorithms, and in many cases on machine learning algorithms to do this work.

The analysis in this article gets inside the algorithms themselves. I cite existing literatures in computer science, known industry practices (as they are publicly presented), and do some testing and manipulation of code as a form of lightweight code audit.

In particular, it is unclear what it means to be interpretable and how to select, evaluate, or even discuss methods for producing interpretations of machine-learning models. We aim to clarify these concerns by defining interpretable machine learning and constructing a unifying framework for existing methods which highlights the underappreciated role played by human audiences. Within this framework, methods are organized into 2 classes: model based and post hoc. To provide guidance in selecting and evaluating interpretation methods, we introduce 3 desiderata: predictive accuracy, descriptive accuracy, and relevancy. Using our framework, we review existing work, grounded in real-world studies which exemplify our desiderata, and suggest directions for future work.", "abstract_source": "openalex", "authors": ["William J.

As a starting point, we introduce machine learning principles, algorithms, descriptors, and databases in materials science. We continue with the description of different machine learning approaches for the discovery of stable materials and the prediction of their crystal structure. Then we discuss research in numerous quantitative structure–property relationships and various approaches for the replacement of first-principle methods by machine learning. We review how active learning and surrogate-based optimization can be applied to improve the rational design process and related examples of applications.

The state-of-the-art and most popular such machine-learning algorithms are Convolutional and Deep Neural Networks (CNNs and DNNs), which are known to be both computationally and memory intensive. A number of neural network accelerators have been recently proposed which can offer high computational capacity/area ratio, but which remain hampered by memory accesses. However, unlike the memory wall faced by processors on general-purpose workloads, the CNNs and DNNs memory footprint, while large, is not beyond the capability of the on chip storage of a multi-chip system. This property, combined with the CNN/DNN algorithmic characteristics, can lead to high internal bandwidth and low external communications, which can in turn enable high-degree parallelism at a reasonable area cost. In this article, we introduce a custom multi-chip machine-learning architecture along those lines. We show that, on a subset of the largest known neural network layers, it is possible to achieve a speedup of 450.65x over a GPU, and reduce the energy by 150.31x on average for a 64-chip system.

Dataset shift is a common problem in predictive modeling that occurs when the joint distribution of inputs and outputs differs between training and test stages. Covariate shift, a particular case of dataset shift, occurs when only the input distribution changes. Dataset shift is present in most practical applications, for reasons ranging from the bias introduced by experimental design to the irreproducibility of the testing conditions at training time. (An example is -email spam filtering, which may fail to recognize spam that differs in form from the spam the automatic filter has been built on.) Despite this, and despite the attention given to the apparently similar problems of semi-supervised learning and active learning, dataset shift has received relatively little attention in the machine learning community until recently. This volume offers an overview of current efforts to deal with dataset and covariate shift.

GPs have been applied in a large number of fields to a diverse range of ends, and very many deep theoretical analyses of various properties are available. This paper gives an introduction to Gaussian processes on a fairly elementary level with special emphasis on characteristics relevant in machine learning. It draws explicit connections to branches such as spline smoothing models and support vector machines in which similar ideas have been investigated. Gaussian process models are routinely used to solve hard machine learning problems. They are attractive because of their flexible non-parametric nature and computational simplicity. Treated within a Bayesian framework, very powerful statistical methods can be implemented which offer valid estimates of uncertainties in our predictions and generic model selection procedures cast as nonlinear optimization problems. Their main drawback of heavy computational scaling has recently been alleviated by the introduction of generic sparse approximations. 13,78,31 The mathematical literature on GPs is large and often uses deep concepts which are not required to fully understand most machine learning applications. In this tutorial paper, we aim to present characteristics of GPs relevant to machine learning and to show up precise connections to other \"kernel machines\" popular in the community.

The repeatability is important because the same scene viewed from different positions should yield features which correspond to the same real-world 3D locations. The efficiency is important because this determines whether the detector combined with further processing can operate at frame rate. Three advances are described in this paper. First, we present a new heuristic for feature detection and, using machine learning, we derive a feature detector from this which can fully process live PAL video using less than 5 percent of the available processing time. By comparison, most other detectors cannot even operate at frame rate (Harris detector 115 percent, SIFT 195 percent). Second, we generalize the detector, allowing it to be optimized for repeatability, with little loss of efficiency. Third, we carry out a rigorous comparison of corner detectors based on the above repeatability criterion applied to 3D scenes. We show that, despite being principally constructed for speed, on these stringent tests, our heuristic detector significantly outperforms existing feature detectors. Finally, the comparison demonstrates that using machine learning produces significant improvements in repeatability, yielding a detector that is both very fast and of very high quality.", "abstract_source": "openalex", "authors": ["Edward Rosten", "Reid Porter", "Tom Drummond"], "publish_year": 2008, "venue": "", "citation_count": 1809, "fields_of_study": ["Artificial intelligence", "Computer science", "Computer vision", "Mathematics", "Statistics", "Linguistics", "Philosophy", "Telecommunications"], "url": "https://openalex.org/W2170282673"}

{"source": "openalex", "paper_id": "https://openalex.org/W3123436326", "title": "Double/debiased machine learning for treatment and structural parameters", "abstract": "We revisit the classic semi‐parametric problem of inference on a low‐dimensional parameter θ0 in the presence of high‐dimensional nuisance parameters η0. We depart from the classical setting by allowing for η0 to be so high‐dimensional that the traditional assumptions (e.g. Donsker properties) that limit complexity of the parameter space for this object break down. To estimate η0, we consider the use of statistical or machine learning (ML) methods, which are particularly well suited to estimation in modern, very high‐dimensional cases. ML methods perform well by employing regularization to reduce variance and trading off regularization bias with overfitting in practice. However, both regularization bias and overfitting in estimating η0 cause a heavy bias in estimators of θ0 that are obtained by naively plugging ML estimators of η0 into estimating equations for θ0. This bias results in the naive estimator failing to be N−1/2 consistent, where N is the sample size. We show that the impact of regularization bias and overfitting on estimation of the parameter of interest θ0 can be removed by using two simple, yet critical, ingredients: (1) using Neyman‐orthogonal moments/scores that have reduced sensitivity with respect to nuisance parameters to estimate θ0; (2) making use of cross‐fitting, which provides an efficient form of data‐splitting. We call the resulting set of methods double or debiased ML (DML). We verify that DML delivers point estimators that concentrate in an N−1/2‐neighbourhood of the true parameter values and are approximately unbiased and normally distributed, which allows construction of valid confidence statements. The generic statistical theory of DML is elementary and simultaneously relies on only weak theoretical requirements, which will admit the use of a broad array of modern ML methods for estimating the nuisance parameters, such as random forests, lasso, ridge, deep neural nets, boosted trees, and various hybrids and ensembles of these methods. We illustrate the general theory by applying it to provide theoretical properties of the following: DML applied to learn the main regression parameter in a partially linear regression model; DML applied to learn the coefficient on an endogenous variable in a partially linear instrumental variables model; DML applied to learn the average treatment effect and the average treatment effect on the treated under unconfoundedness; DML applied to learn the local average treatment effect in an instrumental variables setting.

As such, it focuses on fundamentals and motivation (using various application examples), aiming to strike an appropriate balance of breadth {\\em and depth} that will enable someone having taken first graduate courses in matrix algebra and probability to get started doing research and/or developing tensor algorithms and software. Some background in applied optimization is useful but not strictly required. The material covered includes tensor rank and rank decomposition; basic tensor factorization models and their relationships and properties (including fairly good coverage of identifiability); broad coverage of algorithms ranging from alternating optimization to stochastic gradient; statistical performance analysis; and applications ranging from source separation to collaborative filtering, mixture and topic modeling, classification, and multilinear subspace learning.", "abstract_source": "openalex", "authors": ["Nicholas D.

Our work is in distinct contrast to the tradition in machine learning of designing (often ingenious) ways to speed up a single algorithm at a time. Specifically, we show that algorithms that fit the Statistical Query model [15] can be written in a certain summation form, which allows them to be easily parallelized on multicore computers. We adapt Google's map-reduce [7] paradigm to demonstrate this parallel speed up technique on a variety of learning algorithms including locally weighted linear regression (LWLR), k-means, logistic regression (LR), naive Bayes (NB), SVM, ICA, PCA, gaussian discriminant analysis (GDA), EM, and backpropagation (NN).

Disease prediction using health data has recently shown a potential application area for these methods. This study aims to identify the key trends among different types of supervised machine learning algorithms, and their performance and usage for disease risk prediction. Methods In this study, extensive research efforts were made to identify those studies that applied more than one supervised machine learning algorithm on single disease prediction. Two databases (i.e., Scopus and PubMed) were searched for different types of search items. Thus, we selected 48 articles in total for the comparison among variants supervised machine learning algorithms for disease prediction. Results We found that the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm is applied most frequently (in 29 studies) followed by the Naïve Bayes algorithm (in 23 studies). However, the Random Forest (RF) algorithm showed superior accuracy comparatively. Of the 17 studies where it was applied, RF showed the highest accuracy in 9 of them, i.e., 53%. This was followed by SVM which topped in 41% of the studies it was considered. Conclusion This study provides a wide overview of the relative performance of different variants of supervised machine learning algorithms for disease prediction. This important information of relative performance can be used to aid researchers in the selection of an appropriate supervised machine learning algorithm for their studies.", "abstract_source": "openalex", "authors": ["Shahadat Uddin", "Arif Khan", "Md Ekramul Hossain", "Mohammad Ali Moni"], "publish_year": 2019, "venue": "", "citation_count": 1510, "fields_of_study": ["Computer science", "Machine learning", "Artificial intelligence", "Algorithm", "Medicine", "Nursing"], "url": "https://openalex.org/W2995098893"}

The goal is to train a high-quality centralized model. We refer to this setting as Federated Optimization. In this setting, communication efficiency is of the utmost importance and minimizing the number of rounds of communication is the principal goal. A motivating example arises when we keep the training data locally on users' mobile devices instead of logging it to a data center for training. In federated optimziation, the devices are used as compute nodes performing computation on their local data in order to update a global model. We suppose that we have extremely large number of devices in the network --- as many as the number of users of a given service, each of which has only a tiny fraction of the total data available. In particular, we expect the number of data points available locally to be much smaller than the number of devices. Additionally, since different users generate data with different patterns, it is reasonable to assume that no device has a representative sample of the overall distribution. We show that existing algorithms are not suitable for this setting, and propose a new algorithm which shows encouraging experimental results for sparse convex problems.

The interplay between optimization and machine learning is one of the most important developments in modern computational science. Optimization formulations and methods are proving to be vital in designing algorithms to extract essential knowledge from huge volumes of data. Machine learning, however, is not simply a consumer of optimization technology but a rapidly evolving field that is itself generating new optimization ideas. This book captures the state of the art of the interaction between optimization and machine learning in a way that is accessible to researchers in both fields. Optimization approaches have enjoyed prominence in machine learning because of their wide applicability and attractive theoretical properties. The increasing complexity, size, and variety of today's machine learning models call for the reassessment of existing assumptions. This book starts the process of reassessment. It describes the resurgence in novel contexts of established frameworks such as first-order methods, stochastic approximations, convex relaxations, interior-point methods, and proximal methods. It also devotes attention to newer themes such as regularized optimization, robust optimization, gradient and subgradient methods, splitting techniques, and second-order methods. Many of these techniques draw inspiration from other fields, including operations research, theoretical computer science, and subfields of optimization. The book will enrich the ongoing cross-fertilization between the machine learning community and these other fields, and within the broader optimization community.", "abstract_source": "openalex", "authors": ["Suvrit Sra", "Sebastian Nowozin", "Stephen J.

In this Letter we explore some theoretical foundations of this link and show how it opens up a new avenue for the design of quantum machine learning algorithms. We interpret the process of encoding inputs in a quantum state as a nonlinear feature map that maps data to quantum Hilbert space. A quantum computer can now analyze the input data in this feature space. Based on this link, we discuss two approaches for building a quantum model for classification. In the first approach, the quantum device estimates inner products of quantum states to compute a classically intractable kernel. The kernel can be fed into any classical kernel method such as a support vector machine. In the second approach, we use a variational quantum circuit as a linear model that classifies data explicitly in Hilbert space.

To address this problem, currently a paradigm change is taking place in the development of interatomic potentials.

Several techniques have been developed and successfully applied for certain application domains. However, this work demands professional knowledge and expert experience. And sometimes it has to resort to the brute-force search. Therefore, if an efficient hyperparameter optimization algorithm can be developed to optimize any given machine learning method, it will greatly improve the efficiency of machine learning. In this paper, we consider building the relationship between the performance of the machine learning models and their hyperparameters by Gaussian processes. In this way, the hyperparameter tuning problem can be abstracted as an optimization problem and Bayesian optimization is used to solve the problem. Bayesian optimization is based on the Bayesian theorem. It sets a prior over the optimization function and gathers the information from the previous sample to update the posterior of the optimization function. A utility function selects the next sample point to maximize the optimization function. Several experiments were conducted on standard test datasets.

High dimensional data with a small number of samples is of critical importance for identifying biomarkers and conducting feasibility and pilot work, however it can lead to biased machine learning (ML) performance estimates. Our review of studies which have applied ML to predict autistic from non-autistic individuals showed that small sample size is associated with higher reported classification accuracy. Thus, we have investigated whether this bias could be caused by the use of validation methods which do not sufficiently control overfitting. Our simulations show that K-fold Cross-Validation (CV) produces strongly biased performance estimates with small sample sizes, and the bias is still evident with sample size of 1000. Nested CV and train/test split approaches produce robust and unbiased performance estimates regardless of sample size. We also show that feature selection if performed on pooled training and testing data is contributing to bias considerably more than parameter tuning. In addition, the contribution to bias by data dimensionality, hyper-parameter space and number of CV folds was explored, and validation methods were compared with discriminable data.

Unlike the traditional statistical machine translation, the neural machine translation aims at building a single neural network that can be jointly tuned to maximize the translation performance. The models proposed recently for neural machine translation often belong to a family of encoder-decoders and consists of an encoder that encodes a source sentence into a fixed-length vector from which a decoder generates a translation. In this paper, we conjecture that the use of a fixed-length vector is a bottleneck in improving the performance of this basic encoder-decoder architecture, and propose to extend this by allowing a model to automatically (soft-)search for parts of a source sentence that are relevant to predicting a target word, without having to form these parts as a hard segment explicitly. With this new approach, we achieve a translation performance comparable to the existing state-of-the-art phrase-based system on the task of English-to-French translation.

The realization of this grand potential relies on the ability to extract value from such massive data through data analytics; machine learning is at its core because of its ability to learn from data and provide data driven insights, decisions, and predictions. However, traditional machine learning approaches were developed in a different era, and thus are based upon multiple assumptions, such as the data set fitting entirely into memory, what unfortunately no longer holds true in this new context. These broken assumptions, together with the Big Data characteristics, are creating obstacles for the traditional techniques. Consequently, this paper compiles, summarizes, and organizes machine learning challenges with Big Data. In contrast to other research that discusses challenges, this work highlights the cause-effect relationship by organizing challenges according to Big Data Vs or dimensions that instigated the issue: volume, velocity, variety, or veracity. Moreover, emerging machine learning approaches and techniques are discussed in terms of how they are capable of handling the various challenges with the ultimate objective of helping practitioners select appropriate solutions for their use cases.

A total of 440 radiomic features were extracted from pre-treatment computed tomography (CT) images of 464 lung cancer patients. To ensure the unbiased evaluation of different machine-learning methods, publicly available implementations along with reported parameter configurations were used. Furthermore, we used two independent radiomic cohorts for training (n = 310 patients) and validation (n = 154 patients). We identified that Wilcoxon test based feature selection method WLCX (stability = 0.84 ± 0.05, AUC = 0.65 ± 0.02) and a classification method random forest RF (RSD = 3.52%, AUC = 0.66 ± 0.03) had highest prognostic performance with high stability against data perturbation.

Adversarial examples that affect one model often affect another model, even if the two models have different architectures or were trained on different training sets, so long as both models were trained to perform the same task. An attacker may therefore train their own substitute model, craft adversarial examples against the substitute, and transfer them to a victim model, with very little information about the victim. Recent work has further developed a technique that uses the victim model as an oracle to label a synthetic training set for the substitute, so the attacker need not even collect a training set to mount the attack. We extend these recent techniques using reservoir sampling to greatly enhance the efficiency of the training procedure for the substitute model. We introduce new transferability attacks between previously unexplored (substitute, victim) pairs of machine learning model classes, most notably SVMs and decision trees. We demonstrate our attacks on two commercial machine learning classification systems from Amazon (96.19% misclassification rate) and Google (88.94%) using only 800 queries of the victim model, thereby showing that existing machine learning approaches are in general vulnerable to systematic black-box attacks regardless of their structure.", "abstract_source": "openalex", "authors": ["Nicolas Papernot", "Patrick McDaniel", "Ian Goodfellow"], "publish_year": 2016, "venue": "", "citation_count": 1413, "fields_of_study": ["Computer science", "Artificial intelligence", "Machine learning"], "url": "https://openalex.org/W2408141691"}

Yet, scant evidence is available about their relative performance in terms of accuracy and computational requirements. The purpose of this paper is to evaluate such performance across multiple forecasting horizons using a large subset of 1045 monthly time series used in the M3 Competition. After comparing the post-sample accuracy of popular ML methods with that of eight traditional statistical ones, we found that the former are dominated across both accuracy measures used and for all forecasting horizons examined. Moreover, we observed that their computational requirements are considerably greater than those of statistical methods. The paper discusses the results, explains why the accuracy of ML models is below that of statistical ones and proposes some possible ways forward. The empirical results found in our research stress the need for objective and unbiased ways to test the performance of forecasting methods that can be achieved through sizable and open competitions allowing meaningful comparisons and definite conclusions.", "abstract_source": "openalex", "authors": ["Spyros Makridakis", "Evangelos Spiliotis", "Vassilios Assimakopoulos"], "publish_year": 2018, "venue": "", "citation_count": 1251, "fields_of_study": ["Computer science", "Machine learning", "Artificial intelligence", "Econometrics", "Statistics", "Mathematics", "Paleontology", "Chromatography", "Chemistry", "Biology"], "url": "https://openalex.org/W2794778778"}

Automatic differentiation (AD), also called algorithmic differentiation or simply \"autodiff\", is a family of techniques similar to but more general than backpropagation for efficiently and accurately evaluating derivatives of numeric functions expressed as computer programs. AD is a small but established field with applications in areas including computational fluid dynamics, atmospheric sciences, and engineering design optimization. Until very recently, the fields of machine learning and AD have largely been unaware of each other and, in some cases, have independently discovered each other's results. Despite its relevance, general-purpose AD has been missing from the machine learning toolbox, a situation slowly changing with its ongoing adoption under the names \"dynamic computational graphs\" and \"differentiable programming\". We survey the intersection of AD and machine learning, cover applications where AD has direct relevance, and address the main implementation techniques. By precisely defining the main differentiation techniques and their interrelationships, we aim to bring clarity to the usage of the terms \"autodiff\", \"automatic differentiation\", and \"symbolic differentiation\" as these are encountered more and more in machine learning settings.", "abstract_source": "openalex", "authors": ["Atılım Güneş Baydin", "Barak A.

Here, we present two new strategies to address data limitations common in materials science and chemistry. First, we demonstrate a physically-intuitive approach to unify four separate molecular MEGNet models for the internal energy at 0 K and room temperature, enthalpy and Gibbs free energy into a single free energy MEGNet model by incorporating the temperature, pressure and entropy as global state inputs.

This capability is particularly well-suited to medical applications, especially those that depend on complex proteomic and genomic measurements. As a result, machine learning is frequently used in cancer diagnosis and detection. More recently machine learning has been applied to cancer prognosis and prediction. This latter approach is particularly interesting as it is part of a growing trend towards personalized, predictive medicine. In assembling this review we conducted a broad survey of the different types of machine learning methods being used, the types of data being integrated and the performance of these methods in cancer prediction and prognosis. A number of trends are noted, including a growing dependence on protein biomarkers and microarray data, a strong bias towards applications in prostate and breast cancer, and a heavy reliance on \"older\" technologies such artificial neural networks (ANNs) instead of more recently developed or more easily interpretable machine learning methods. A number of published studies also appear to lack an appropriate level of validation or testing. Among the better designed and validated studies it is clear that machine learning methods can be used to substantially (15-25%) improve the accuracy of predicting cancer susceptibility, recurrence and mortality.

To solve the above problems, many researchers have focused on developing IDSs that capitalize on machine learning methods. Machine learning methods can automatically discover the essential differences between normal data and abnormal data with high accuracy. In addition, machine learning methods have strong generalizability, so they are also able to detect unknown attacks. Deep learning is a branch of machine learning, whose performance is remarkable and has become a research hotspot. This survey proposes a taxonomy of IDS that takes data objects as the main dimension to classify and summarize machine learning-based and deep learning-based IDS literature. We believe that this type of taxonomy framework is fit for cyber security researchers. The survey first clarifies the concept and taxonomy of IDSs. Then, the machine learning algorithms frequently used in IDSs, metrics, and benchmark datasets are introduced. Next, combined with the representative literature, we take the proposed taxonomic system as a baseline and explain how to solve key IDS issues with machine learning and deep learning techniques. Finally, challenges and future developments are discussed by reviewing recent representative studies.", "abstract_source": "openalex", "authors": ["Hongyu Liu", "Bo Lang"], "publish_year": 2019, "venue": "", "citation_count": 968, "fields_of_study": ["Computer science", "Artificial intelligence", "Machine learning", "Statistics", "Mathematics"], "url": "https://openalex.org/W2980576170"}

This goal has forced organizations to evolve their development processes. We report on a study that we conducted on observing software teams at Microsoft as they develop AI-based applications. We consider a nine-stage workflow process informed by prior experiences developing AI applications (e.g., search and NLP) and data science tools (e.g. application diagnostics and bug reporting). We found that various Microsoft teams have united this workflow into preexisting, well-evolved, Agile-like software engineering processes, providing insights about several essential engineering challenges that organizations may face in creating large-scale AI solutions for the marketplace. We collected some best practices from Microsoft teams to address these challenges. In addition, we have identified three aspects of the AI domain that make it fundamentally different from prior software application domains: 1) discovering, managing, and versioning the data needed for machine learning applications is much more complex and difficult than other types of software engineering, 2) model customization and model reuse require very different skills than are typically found in software teams, and 3) AI components are more difficult to handle as distinct modules than traditional software components - models may be \"entangled\" in complex ways and experience non-monotonic error behavior.

Because machine-learning models learn from historically collected data, populations that have experienced human and structural biases in the past-called protected groups-are vulnerable to harm by incorrect predictions or withholding of resources. This article describes how model design, biases in data, and the interactions of model predictions with clinicians and patients may exacerbate health care disparities. Rather than simply guarding against these harms passively, machine-learning systems should be used proactively to advance health equity. For that goal to be achieved, principles of distributive justice must be incorporated into model design, deployment, and evaluation. The article describes several technical implementations of distributive justice-specifically those that ensure equality in patient outcomes, performance, and resource allocation-and guides clinicians as to when they should prioritize each principle. Machine learning is providing increasingly sophisticated decision support and population-level monitoring, and it should encode principles of justice to ensure that models benefit all patients.", "abstract_source": "openalex", "authors": ["Alvin Rajkomar", "Michaela Hardt", "Michael Howell", "Greg S.

So far, distributed machine learning frameworks have largely ignored the possibility of failures, especially arbitrary (i.e., Byzantine) ones. Causes of failures include software bugs, network asynchrony, biases in local datasets, as well as attackers trying to compromise the entire system. Assuming a set of n workers, up to f being Byzantine, we ask how resilient can SGD be, without limiting the dimension, nor the size of the parameter space. We first show that no gradient aggregation rule based on a linear combination of the vectors proposed by the workers (i.e, current approaches) tolerates a single Byzantine failure. We then formulate a resilience property of the aggregation rule capturing the basic requirements to guarantee convergence despite f Byzantine workers.

Thus, interpretability has become a vital concern in machine learning, and work in the area of interpretable models has found renewed interest. In some applications, such models are as accurate as non-interpretable ones, and thus are preferred for their transparency. Even when they are not accurate, they may still be preferred when interpretability is of paramount importance. However, restricting machine learning to interpretable models is often a severe limitation. In this paper we argue for explaining machine learning predictions using model-agnostic approaches. By treating the machine learning models as black-box functions, these approaches provide crucial flexibility in the choice of models, explanations, and representations, improving debugging, comparison, and interfaces for a variety of users and models.

Two facets of mechanization should be acknowledged when considering machine learning in broad terms. Firstly, it is intended that the classification and prediction tasks can be accomplished by a suitably programmed computing machine. That is, the product of machine learning is a classifier that can be feasibly used on available hardware. Secondly, it is intended that the creation of the classifier should itself be highly mechanized, and should not involve too much human input. This second facet is inevitably vague, but the basic objective is that the use of automatic algorithm construction methods can minimize the possibility that human biases could affect the selection and performance of the algorithm. Both the creation of the algorithm and its operation to classify objects or predict events are to be based on concrete, observable data.\r\n\r\nThe history of relations between biology and the field of machine learning is long and complex. An early technique [1] for machine learning called the perceptron constituted an attempt to model actual neuronal behavior, and the field of artificial neural network (ANN) design emerged from this attempt. Early work on the analysis of translation initiation sequences [2] employed the perceptron to define criteria for start sites in Escherichia coli. Further artificial neural network architectures such as the adaptive resonance theory (ART) [3] and neocognitron [4] were inspired from the organization of the visual nervous system. In the intervening years, the flexibility of machine learning techniques has grown along with mathematical frameworks for measuring their reliability, and it is natural to hope that machine learning methods will improve the efficiency of discovery and understanding in the mounting volume and complexity of biological data.\r\n\r\nThis tutorial is structured in four main components. Firstly, a brief section reviews definitions and mathematical prerequisites. Secondly, the field of supervised learning is described. Thirdly, methods of unsupervised learning are reviewed. Finally, a section reviews methods and examples as implemented in the open source data analysis and visualization language R (http://www.r-project.org).", "abstract_source": "openalex", "authors": ["Adi L.

The research on the advancement of flood prediction models contributed to risk reduction, policy suggestion, minimization of the loss of human life, and reduction of the property damage associated with floods. To mimic the complex mathematical expressions of physical processes of floods, during the past two decades, machine learning (ML) methods contributed highly in the advancement of prediction systems providing better performance and cost-effective solutions. Due to the vast benefits and potential of ML, its popularity dramatically increased among hydrologists. Researchers through introducing novel ML methods and hybridizing of the existing ones aim at discovering more accurate and efficient prediction models. The main contribution of this paper is to demonstrate the state of the art of ML models in flood prediction and to give insight into the most suitable models. In this paper, the literature where ML models were benchmarked through a qualitative analysis of robustness, accuracy, effectiveness, and speed are particularly investigated to provide an extensive overview on the various ML algorithms used in the field. The performance comparison of ML models presents an in-depth understanding of the different techniques within the framework of a comprehensive evaluation and discussion. As a result, this paper introduces the most promising prediction methods for both long-term and short-term floods. Furthermore, the major trends in improving the quality of the flood prediction models are investigated. Among them, hybridization, data decomposition, algorithm ensemble, and model optimization are reported as the most effective strategies for the improvement of ML methods.

The mechanism that drives this cutting edge technology is machine learning (ML). It gives the machine ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. ML together with IoT (Internet of Things) enabled farm machinery are key components of the next agriculture revolution. In this article, authors present a systematic review of ML applications in the field of agriculture. The areas that are focused are prediction of soil parameters such as organic carbon and moisture content, crop yield prediction, disease and weed detection in crops and species detection. ML with computer vision are reviewed for the classification of a different set of crop images in order to monitor the crop quality and yield assessment. This approach can be integrated for enhanced livestock production by predicting fertility patterns, diagnosing eating disorders, cattle behaviour based on ML models using data collected by collar sensors, etc. Intelligent irrigation which includes drip irrigation and intelligent harvesting techniques are also reviewed that reduces human labour to a great extent.

In large-scale systems there are several types of noise that can affect the performance of distributed machine learning algorithms -- straggler nodes, system failures, or communication bottlenecks -- but there has been little interaction cutting across codes, machine learning, and distributed systems. In this work, we provide theoretical insights on how coded solutions can achieve significant gains compared to uncoded ones. We focus on two of the most basic building blocks of distributed learning algorithms: matrix multiplication and data shuffling. For matrix multiplication, we use codes to alleviate the effect of stragglers, and show that if the number of homogeneous workers is $n$, and the runtime of each subtask has an exponential tail, coded computation can speed up distributed matrix multiplication by a factor of $\\log n$. For data shuffling, we use codes to reduce communication bottlenecks, exploiting the excess in storage. We show that when a constant fraction $\\alpha$ of the data matrix can be cached at each worker, and $n$ is the number of workers, \\emph{coded shuffling} reduces the communication cost by a factor of $(\\alpha + \\frac{1}{n})\\gamma(n)$ compared to uncoded shuffling, where $\\gamma(n)$ is the ratio of the cost of unicasting $n$ messages to $n$ users to multicasting a common message (of the same size) to $n$ users. For instance, $\\gamma(n) \\simeq n$ if multicasting a message to $n$ users is as cheap as unicasting a message to one user. We also provide experiment results, corroborating our theoretical gains of the coded algorithms.", "abstract_source": "openalex", "authors": ["Kangwook Lee", "Maximilian Lam", "Ramtin Pedarsani", "Dimitris Papailiopoulos", "Kannan Ramchandran"], "publish_year": 2017, "venue": "", "citation_count": 843, "fields_of_study": ["Computer science", "Distributed computing", "Theoretical computer science", "Algorithm", "Parallel computing", "Mathematics", "Combinatorics", "Physics", "Quantum mechanics", "Programming language"], "url": "https://openalex.org/W2268702383"}

A growing body of prior work demonstrates that models produced by these algorithms may leak specific private information in the training data to an attacker, either through the models' structure or their observable behavior. However, the underlying cause of this privacy risk is not well understood beyond a handful of anecdotal accounts that suggest overfitting and influence might play a role. This paper examines the effect that overfitting and influence have on the ability of an attacker to learn information about the training data from machine learning models, either through training set membership inference or attribute inference attacks. Using both formal and empirical analyses, we illustrate a clear relationship between these factors and the privacy risk that arises in several popular machine learning algorithms. We find that overfitting is sufficient to allow an attacker to perform membership inference and, when the target attribute meets certain conditions about its influence, attribute inference attacks. Interestingly, our formal analysis also shows that overfitting is not necessary for these attacks and begins to shed light on what other factors may be in play. Finally, we explore the connection between membership inference and attribute inference, showing that there are deep connections between the two that lead to effective new attacks.", "abstract_source": "openalex", "authors": ["Samuel Yeom", "Irene Giacomelli", "Matt Fredrikson", "Somesh Jha"], "publish_year": 2018, "venue": "", "citation_count": 826, "fields_of_study": ["Machine learning", "Computer science", "Artificial intelligence"], "url": "https://openalex.org/W2795435272"}

In this paper, we streamline machine learning algorithms for effective prediction of chronic disease outbreak in disease-frequent communities. We experiment the modified prediction models over real-life hospital data collected from central China in 2013-2015. To overcome the difficulty of incomplete data, we use a latent factor model to reconstruct the missing data. We experiment on a regional chronic disease of cerebral infarction. We propose a new convolutional neural network (CNN)-based multimodal disease risk prediction algorithm using structured and unstructured data from hospital. To the best of our knowledge, none of the existing work focused on both data types in the area of medical big data analytics.

A subset of artificial intelligence, namely machine learning, has a considerable potential to handle numerous challenges in the establishment of knowledge-based farming systems. The present study aims at shedding light on machine learning in agriculture by thoroughly reviewing the recent scholarly literature based on keywords’ combinations of “machine learning” along with “crop management”, “water management”, “soil management”, and “livestock management”, and in accordance with PRISMA guidelines. Only journal papers were considered eligible that were published within 2018–2020. The results indicated that this topic pertains to different disciplines that favour convergence research at the international level. Furthermore, crop management was observed to be at the centre of attention. A plethora of machine learning algorithms were used, with those belonging to Artificial Neural Networks being more efficient. In addition, maize and wheat as well as cattle and sheep were the most investigated crops and animals, respectively. Finally, a variety of sensors, attached on satellites and unmanned ground and aerial vehicles, have been utilized as a means of getting reliable input data for the data analyses. It is anticipated that this study will constitute a beneficial guide to all stakeholders towards enhancing awareness of the potential advantages of using machine learning in agriculture and contributing to a more systematic research on this topic.", "abstract_source": "openalex", "authors": ["Lefteris Benos", "Aristotelis C.

The data set comprising bcc (Li, Mo) and fcc (Cu, Ni) metals and diamond group IV semiconductors (Si, Ge) is chosen to span a range of crystal structures and bonding. All descriptors studied show excellent performance in predicting energies and forces far surpassing that of classical IAPs, as well as predicting properties such as elastic constants and phonon dispersion curves.

Aleatoric uncertainty captures noise inherent in the observations. On the other hand, epistemic uncertainty accounts for uncertainty in the model -- uncertainty which can be explained away given enough data. Traditionally it has been difficult to model epistemic uncertainty in computer vision, but with new Bayesian deep learning tools this is now possible. We study the benefits of modeling epistemic vs. aleatoric uncertainty in Bayesian deep learning models for vision tasks. For this we present a Bayesian deep learning framework combining input-dependent aleatoric uncertainty together with epistemic uncertainty. We study models under the framework with per-pixel semantic segmentation and depth regression tasks. Further, our explicit uncertainty formulation leads to new loss functions for these tasks, which can be interpreted as learned attenuation. This makes the loss more robust to noisy data, also giving new state-of-the-art results on segmentation and depth regression benchmarks.", "abstract_source": "openalex", "authors": ["Alex Kendall", "Yarin Gal"], "publish_year": 2017, "venue": "", "citation_count": 2520, "fields_of_study": ["Artificial intelligence", "Computer science", "Machine learning", "Simulation"], "url": "https://openalex.org/W2600383743"}

In the field of computer vision, it has become the workhorse for applications ranging from self-driving cars to surveillance and security. Whereas, deep neural networks have demonstrated phenomenal success (often beyond human capabilities) in solving complex problems, recent studies show that they are vulnerable to adversarial attacks in the form of subtle perturbations to inputs that lead a model to predict incorrect outputs. For images, such perturbations are often too small to be perceptible, yet they completely fool the deep learning models. Adversarial attacks pose a serious threat to the success of deep learning in practice. This fact has recently led to a large influx of contributions in this direction. This paper presents the first comprehensive survey on adversarial attacks on deep learning in computer vision. We review the works that design adversarial attacks, analyze the existence of such attacks and propose defenses against them. To emphasize that adversarial attacks are possible in practical conditions, we separately review the contributions that evaluate adversarial attacks in the real-world scenarios.

We start by briefly summarizing a decade of progress in convolutional neural networks, including the vision tasks they enable, in the context of healthcare.

We present here a comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art computer vision for traffic video with a critical analysis and an outlook to future research directions. This field is of increasing relevance for intelligent transport systems (ITSs). The decreasing hardware cost and, therefore, the increasing deployment of cameras have opened a wide application field for video analytics. Several monitoring objectives such as congestion, traffic rule violation, and vehicle interaction can be targeted using cameras that were typically originally installed for human operators. Systems for the detection and classification of vehicles on highways have successfully been using classical visual surveillance techniques such as background estimation and motion tracking for some time. The urban domain is more challenging with respect to traffic density, lower camera angles that lead to a high degree of occlusion, and the variety of road users. Methods from object categorization and 3-D modeling have inspired more advanced techniques to tackle these challenges. There is no commonly used data set or benchmark challenge, which makes the direct comparison of the proposed algorithms difficult.

Ophthalmic Physiol Opt 2011, 31 , 502–515. doi: 10.1111/j.1475‐1313.2011.00834.x Abstract Computer vision syndrome (CVS) is the combination of eye and vision problems associated with the use of computers. In modern western society the use of computers for both vocational and avocational activities is almost universal. However, CVS may have a significant impact not only on visual comfort but also occupational productivity since between 64% and 90% of computer users experience visual symptoms which may include eyestrain, headaches, ocular discomfort, dry eye, diplopia and blurred vision either at near or when looking into the distance after prolonged computer use. This paper reviews the principal ocular causes for this condition, namely oculomotor anomalies and dry eye. Accommodation and vergence responses to electronic screens appear to be similar to those found when viewing printed materials, whereas the prevalence of dry eye symptoms is greater during computer operation. The latter is probably due to a decrease in blink rate and blink amplitude, as well as increased corneal exposure resulting from the monitor frequently being positioned in primary gaze. However, the efficacy of proposed treatments to reduce symptoms of CVS is unproven. A better understanding of the physiology underlying CVS is critical to allow more accurate diagnosis and treatment. This will enable practitioners to optimize visual comfort and efficiency during computer operation.", "abstract_source": "openalex", "authors": ["Mark Rosenfield"], "publish_year": 2011, "venue": "", "citation_count": 654, "fields_of_study": ["Optometry", "Medicine", "Ophthalmology", "Psychology", "Computer science", "Surgery", "Computer vision", "Neuroscience"], "url": "https://openalex.org/W1490164115"}

Deep CNN (convolution neural network) has benefited the computer vision community by producing excellent results in video processing, object recognition, picture classification and segmentation, natural language processing, speech recognition, and many other fields. Furthermore, the introduction of large amounts of data and readily available hardware has opened new avenues for CNN study. Several inspirational concepts for the progress of CNN have been investigated, including alternative activation functions, regularization, parameter optimization, and architectural advances. Furthermore, achieving innovations in architecture results in a tremendous enhancement in the capacity of the deep CNN. Significant emphasis has been given to leveraging channel and spatial information, with a depth of architecture and information processing via multi-path. This survey paper focuses mainly on the primary taxonomy and newly released deep CNN architectures, and it divides numerous recent developments in CNN architectures into eight groups. Spatial exploitation, multi-path, depth, breadth, dimension, channel boosting, feature-map exploitation, and attention-based CNN are the eight categories. The main contribution of this manuscript is in comparing various architectural evolutions in CNN by its architectural change, strengths, and weaknesses.

Due to the computer vision technology application advantages such as non-contact, long distance, rapid, low cost and labor, and low interference to the daily operation of structures, it is promising to consider computer vision–structural health monitoring as a complement to the conventional structural health monitoring. This article presents a general overview of the concepts, approaches, and real-life practice of computer vision–structural health monitoring along with some relevant literature that is rapidly accumulating. The computer vision–structural health monitoring covered in this article at local level includes applications such as crack, spalling, delamination, rust, and loose bolt detection. At the global level, applications include displacement measurement, structural behavior analysis, vibration serviceability, modal identification, model updating, damage detection, cable force monitoring, load factor estimation, and structural identification using input–output information. The current research studies and applications of computer vision–structural health monitoring mainly focus on the implementation and integration of two-dimensional computer vision techniques to solve structural health monitoring problems and the projective geometry methods implemented are utilized to convert the three-dimensional problems into two-dimensional problems. This review mainly puts emphasis on two-dimensional computer vision–structural health monitoring applications. Subsequently, a brief review of representative developments of three-dimensional computer vision in the area of civil engineering is presented along with the challenges and opportunities of two-dimensional and three-dimensional computer vision–structural health monitoring.

Increasingly, robust estimation techniques, some borrowed from the statistics literature and others described in the computer vision literature, have been used in solving these parameter estimation problems. Ideally, these techniques should effectively ignore the outliers and measurements from other populations, treating them as outliers, when estimating the parameters of a single population. Two frequently used techniques are least-median of squares (LMS) [P. J. Rousseeuw, {J. Amer. Statist. Assoc., 79 (1984), pp. 871--880] and M-estimators [Robust Statistics: The Approach Based on Influence Functions, F. R. Hampel et al., John Wiley, 1986; Robust Statistics, P. J. Huber, John Wiley, 1981]. LMS handles large fractions of outliers, up to the theoretical limit of 50% for estimators invariant to affine changes to the data, but has low statistical efficiency. M-estimators have higher statistical efficiency but tolerate much lower percentages of outliers unless properly initialized. While robust estimators have been used in a variety of computer vision applications, three are considered here. In analysis of range images---images containing depth or X, Y, Z measurements at each pixel instead of intensity measurements---robust estimators have been used successfully to estimate surface model parameters in small image regions. In stereo and motion analysis, they have been used to estimate parameters of what is called the 'fundamental matrix,' which characterizes the relative imaging geometry of two cameras imaging the same scene. Recently, robust estimators have been applied to estimating a quadratic image-to-image transformation model necessary to create a composite, 'mosaic image' from a series of images of the human retina. In each case, a straightforward application of standard robust estimators is insufficient, and carefully developed extensions are used to solve the problem.", "abstract_source": "openalex", "authors": ["Charles V.

Each technique is introduced by way of a brief discussion of its purpose and methodology.

The development of a fully automated web inspection system requires robust and efficient fabric defect detection algorithms. The inspection of real fabric defects is particularly challenging due to the large number of fabric defect classes, which are characterized by their vagueness and ambiguity. Numerous techniques have been developed to detect fabric defects and the purpose of this paper is to categorize and/or describe these algorithms. This paper attempts to present the first survey on fabric defect detection techniques presented in about 160 references. Categorization of fabric defect detection techniques is useful in evaluating the qualities of identified features. The characterization of real fabric surfaces using their structure and primitive set has not yet been successful. Therefore, on the basis of the nature of features from the fabric surfaces, the proposed approaches have been characterized into three categories; statistical, spectral and model-based. In order to evaluate the state-of-the-art, the limitations of several promising techniques are identified and performances are analyzed in the context of their demonstrated results and intended application. The conclusions from this paper also suggest that the combination of statistical, spectral and model-based approaches can give better results than any single approach, and is suggested for further research.", "abstract_source": "openalex", "authors": ["Ajay Kumar"], "publish_year": 2008, "venue": "", "citation_count": 678, "fields_of_study": ["Computer science", "Artificial intelligence", "Computer vision", "Data mining", "Paleontology", "Programming language", "Biology"], "url": "https://openalex.org/W2109925328"}

Although these reports come from a wide range of insect taxa and regions, the evidence to assess the extent of the phenomenon is sparse. Insect populations are challenging to study, and most monitoring methods are labor intensive and inefficient. Advances in computer vision and deep learning provide potential new solutions to this global challenge. Cameras and other sensors can effectively, continuously, and noninvasively perform entomological observations throughout diurnal and seasonal cycles. The physical appearance of specimens can also be captured by automated imaging in the laboratory. When trained on these data, deep learning models can provide estimates of insect abundance, biomass, and diversity. Further, deep learning models can quantify variation in phenotypic traits, behavior, and interactions. Here, we connect recent developments in deep learning and computer vision to the urgent demand for more cost-efficient monitoring of insects and other invertebrates. We present examples of sensor-based monitoring of insects. We show how deep learning tools can be applied to exceptionally large datasets to derive ecological information and discuss the challenges that lie ahead for the implementation of such solutions in entomology.

One drawback of typical PCA methods is that they are least squares estimation techniques and hence fail to account for \"outliers\" which are common in realistic training sets. In computer vision applications, outliers typically occur within a sample (image) due to pixels that are corrupted by noise, alignment errors, or occlusion. We review previous approaches for making PCA robust to outliers and present a new method that uses an intra-sample outlier process to account for pixel outliers. We develop the theory of Robust Principal Component Analysis (RPCA) and describe a robust M-estimation algorithm for learning linear multi-variate representations of high dimensional data such as images. Quantitative comparisons with traditional PCA and previous robust algorithms illustrate the benefits of RPCA when outliers are present.

With such strategies, sensor parameters values can be selected and can be purposefully changed in order to effectively perform the task at hand.

For this task, camera and illumination parameters such as position, orientation, and optical settings are determined so that object features are, for example, visible, in focus, within the sensor field of view, magnified as required, and imaged with sufficient contrast. References to, and a brief description of, representative sensing strategies for the tasks of object recognition and scene reconstruction are also presented.

Computer vision foundation models, which are trained on diverse, large-scale dataset and can be adapted to a wide range of downstream tasks, are critical for this mission to solve real-world computer vision applications. While existing vision foundation models such as CLIP, ALIGN, and Wu Dao 2.0 focus mainly on mapping images and textual representations to a cross-modal shared representation, we introduce a new computer vision foundation model, Florence, to expand the representations from coarse (scene) to fine (object), from static (images) to dynamic (videos), and from RGB to multiple modalities (caption, depth). By incorporating universal visual-language representations from Web-scale image-text data, our Florence model can be easily adapted for various computer vision tasks, such as classification, retrieval, object detection, VQA, image caption, video retrieval and action recognition. Moreover, Florence demonstrates outstanding performance in many types of transfer learning: fully sampled fine-tuning, linear probing, few-shot transfer and zero-shot transfer for novel images and objects. All of these properties are critical for our vision foundation model to serve general purpose vision tasks. Florence achieves new state-of-the-art results in majority of 44 representative benchmarks, e.g., ImageNet-1K zero-shot classification with top-1 accuracy of 83.74 and the top-5 accuracy of 97.18, 62.4 mAP on COCO fine tuning, 80.36 on VQA, and 87.8 on Kinetics-600.", "abstract_source": "openalex", "authors": ["Lu Yuan", "Dongdong Chen", "Yi‐Ling Chen", "Noel Codella", "Xiyang Dai", "Jianfeng Gao", "Houdong Hu", "Xuedong Huang", "Boxin Li", "Chunyuan Li", "Ce Liu", "Mengchen Liu", "Zicheng Liu", "Yumao Lu", "Yu Shi", "Lijuan Wang", "Jianfeng Wang", "Bin Xiao", "Zhen Xiao", "Jianwei Yang", "Michael Zeng", "Luowei Zhou", "Pengchuan Zhang"], "publish_year": 2021, "venue": "", "citation_count": 338, "fields_of_study": ["Computer science", "Artificial intelligence", "Computer vision", "Optics", "Physics", "Archaeology", "Law", "History", "Political science"], "url": "https://openalex.org/W3215626407"}

Aleatoric uncertainty captures noise inherent in the observations. On the other hand, epistemic uncertainty accounts for uncertainty in the model -- uncertainty which can be explained away given enough data. Traditionally it has been difficult to model epistemic uncertainty in computer vision, but with new Bayesian deep learning tools this is now possible. We study the benefits of modeling epistemic vs. aleatoric uncertainty in Bayesian deep learning models for vision tasks. For this we present a Bayesian deep learning framework combining input-dependent aleatoric uncertainty together with epistemic uncertainty. We study models under the framework with per-pixel semantic segmentation and depth regression tasks. Further, our explicit uncertainty formulation leads to new loss functions for these tasks, which can be interpreted as learned attenuation. This makes the loss more robust to noisy data, also giving new state-of-the-art results on segmentation and depth regression benchmarks.", "abstract_source": "openalex", "authors": ["Alex Kendall", "Yarin Gal"], "publish_year": 2017, "venue": "", "citation_count": 520, "fields_of_study": ["Artificial intelligence", "Computer science", "Machine learning", "Mathematics", "Statistics", "Simulation"], "url": "https://openalex.org/W2950517871"}

The proposed robust competitive agglomeration (RCA) algorithm starts with a large number of clusters to reduce the sensitivity to initialization, and determines the actual number of clusters by a process of competitive agglomeration. Noise immunity is achieved by incorporating concepts from robust statistics into the algorithm. RCA assigns two different sets of weights for each data point: the first set of constrained weights represents degrees of sharing, and is used to create a competitive environment and to generate a fuzzy partition of the data set. The second set corresponds to robust weights, and is used to obtain robust estimates of the cluster prototypes. By choosing an appropriate distance measure in the objective function, RCA can be used to find an unknown number of clusters of various shapes in noisy data sets, as well as to fit an unknown number of parametric models simultaneously.

They have significant advantages over conventional cameras: high temporal resolution, high dynamic range, and no motion blur. Since the output of event cameras is fundamentally different from conventional cam-eras, it is commonly accepted that they require the development of specialized algorithms to accommodate the particular nature of events. In this work, we take a different view and propose to apply existing, mature computer vision techniques to videos reconstructed from event data. We propose a novel recurrent network to reconstruct videos from a stream of events, and train it on a large amount of simulated event data. Our experiments show that our approach surpasses state-of-the-art reconstruction methods by a large margin (&gt;20%) in terms of image quality. We further apply off-the-shelf computer vision algorithms to videos reconstructed from event data on tasks such as object classification and visual-inertial odometry,and show that this strategy consistently outperforms algorithms that were specifically designed for event data. We believe that our approach opens the door to bringing the outstanding properties of event cameras to an entirely new range of tasks.

As a result, the analysis and mining of structural health monitoring data have become hot research topics in the field of civil engineering. However, the harsh environment of civil structures causes the data measured by structural health monitoring systems to be contaminated by multiple anomalies, which seriously affect the data analysis results. This is one of the main barriers to automatic real-time warning, because it is difficult to distinguish the anomalies caused by structural damage from those related to incorrect data. Existing methods for data cleansing mainly focus on noise filtering, whereas the detection of incorrect data requires expertise and is very time-consuming. Inspired by the real-world manual inspection process, this article proposes a computer vision and deep learning–based data anomaly detection method. In particular, the framework of the proposed method includes two steps: data conversion by data visualization, and the construction and training of deep neural networks for anomaly classification. This process imitates human biological vision and logical thinking. In the data visualization step, the time series signals are transformed into image vectors that are plotted piecewise in grayscale images. In the second step, a training dataset consisting of randomly selected and manually labeled image vectors is input into a deep neural network or a cluster of deep neural networks, which are trained via techniques termed stacked autoencoders and greedy layer-wise training. The trained deep neural networks can be used to detect potential anomalies in large amounts of unchecked structural health monitoring data. To illustrate the training procedure and validate the performance of the proposed method, acceleration data from the structural health monitoring system of a real long-span bridge in China are employed. The results show that the multi-pattern anomalies of the data can be automatically detected with high accuracy.", "abstract_source": "openalex", "authors": ["Yuequan Bao", "Zhiyi Tang", "Hui Li", "Yufeng Zhang"], "publish_year": 2018, "venue": "", "citation_count": 544, "fields_of_study": ["Computer science", "Artificial intelligence", "Data mining", "Machine learning", "Operating system"], "url": "https://openalex.org/W2791957585"}

Where the application of this technique differs in computer vision from other fields is in the variety and severity of the registration transformation between the images. In particular this transformation is generally unknown, and a significant component of solving the SR problem in computer vision is the estimation of the transformation. The transformation may have a simple parametric form, or it may be scene dependent and have to be estimated for every point. In either case the transformation is estimated directly and automatically from the images. We describe the two key components that are necessary for successful SR restoration: the accurate alignment or registration of the LR images and the formulation of an SR estimator that uses a generative image model together with a prior model of the super-resolved image itself.

However, substantial economic and logistical costs limit this application, especially for observing phenological dynamics in ecosystem structure and spectral traits. Here we demonstrate a new aerial remote sensing system enabling routine and inexpensive aerial 3D measurements of canopy structure and spectral attributes, with properties similar to those of LIDAR, but with RGB (red-green-blue) spectral attributes for each point, enabling high frequency observations within a single growing season. This \"Ecosynth\" methodology applies photogrammetric \"Structure from Motion\" computer vision algorithms to large sets of highly overlapping low altitude (< 130 m) aerial photographs acquired using off-the-shelf digital cameras mounted on an inexpensive (< USD$4000), lightweight (< 2 kg), hobbyist-grade unmanned aerial system (UAS). Ecosynth 3D point clouds with densities of 30–67 points m− 2 were produced using commercial computer vision software from digital photographs acquired repeatedly by UAS over three 6.25 ha (250 m × 250 m) Temperate Deciduous forest sites in Maryland USA. Ecosynth point clouds were georeferenced with a precision of 1.2–4.1 m horizontal radial root mean square error (RMSE) and 0.4–1.2 m vertical RMSE. Understory digital terrain models (DTMs) and canopy height models (CHMs) were generated from leaf-on and leaf-off point clouds using procedures commonly applied to LIDAR point clouds. At two sites, Ecosynth CHMs were strong predictors of field-measured tree heights (R2 0.63 to 0.84) and were highly correlated with a LIDAR CHM (R 0.87) acquired 4 days earlier, though Ecosynth-based estimates of aboveground biomass and carbon densities included significant errors (31–36% of field-based estimates). Repeated scanning of a 50 m × 50 m forested area at six different times across a 16 month period revealed ecologically significant dynamics in canopy color at different heights and a structural shift upward in canopy density, as demonstrated by changes in vertical height profiles of point density and relative RGB brightness. Changes in canopy relative greenness were highly correlated (R2 = 0.87) with MODIS NDVI time series for the same area and vertical differences in canopy color revealed the early green up of the dominant canopy species, Liriodendron tulipifera, strong evidence that Ecosynth time series measurements can capture vegetation structural and spectral phenological dynamics at the spatial scale of individual trees. The ability to observe canopy phenology in 3D at high temporal resolutions represents a breakthrough in forest ecology.

Despite the significant successes achieved to date, applying GANs to real-world problems still poses significant challenges, three of which we focus on here. These are as follows: (1) the generation of high quality images, (2) diversity of image generation, and (3) stabilizing training. Focusing on the degree to which popular GAN technologies have made progress against these challenges, we provide a detailed review of the state-of-the-art in GAN-related research in the published scientific literature. We further structure this review through a convenient taxonomy we have adopted based on variations in GAN architectures and loss functions. While several reviews for GANs have been presented to date, none have considered the status of this field based on their progress toward addressing practical challenges relevant to computer vision. Accordingly, we review and critically discuss the most popular architecture-variant, and loss-variant GANs, for tackling these challenges. Our objective is to provide an overview as well as a critical analysis of the status of GAN research in terms of relevant progress toward critical computer vision application requirements.

Background: Computer vision, a form of artificial intelligence (AI), allows for quantitative analysis of video by computers for identification of objects and patterns, such as in autonomous driving. Methods: Intraoperative video from LSG from an academic institution was annotated by 2 fellowship-trained, board-certified bariatric surgeons. Videos were segmented into the following steps: 1) port placement, 2) liver retraction, 3) liver biopsy, 4) gastrocolic ligament dissection, 5) stapling of the stomach, 6) bagging specimen, and 7) final inspection of staple line. Deep neural networks were used to analyze videos. Accuracy of operative step identification by the AI was determined by comparing to surgeon annotations. Results: Eighty-eight cases of LSG were analyzed. A random 70% sample of these clips was used to train the AI and 30% to test the AI's performance. Mean concordance correlation coefficient for human annotators was 0.862, suggesting excellent agreement. Mean (±SD) accuracy of the AI in identifying operative steps in the test set was 82% ± 4% with a maximum of 85.6%. Conclusions: AI can extract quantitative surgical data from video with 85.6% accuracy. This suggests operative video could be used as a quantitative data source for research in intraoperative clinical decision support, risk prediction, or outcomes studies.", "abstract_source": "openalex", "authors": ["Daniel A.

The hierarchical processing in the primate visual system is characterized by a sequence of different levels of processing (on the order of 10) that constitute a deep hierarchy in contrast to the flat vision architectures predominantly used in today's mainstream computer vision.

In this work, we challenge this paradigm by (a) representing images as semantic visual tokens and (b) running transformers to densely model token relationships. Critically, our Visual Transformer operates in a semantic token space, judiciously attending to different image parts based on context. This is in sharp contrast to pixel-space transformers that require orders-of-magnitude more compute.

Here, UAV-SFM remote sensing was used to produce 3D multispectral point clouds of Temperate Deciduous forests at different levels of UAV altitude, image overlap, weather, and image processing. Error in canopy height estimates was explained by the alignment of the canopy height model to the digital terrain model (R2 = 0.81) due to differences in lighting and image overlap. Accounting for this, no significant differences were observed in height error at different levels of lighting, altitude, and side overlap. Overall, accurate estimates of canopy height compared to field measurements (R2 = 0.86, RMSE = 3.6 m) and LIDAR (R2 = 0.99, RMSE = 3.0 m) were obtained under optimal conditions of clear lighting and high image overlap (&gt;80%).

When pre-trained on large amounts of data and transferred to multiple mid-sized or small image recognition benchmarks (ImageNet, CIFAR-100, VTAB, etc.), Vision Transformer (ViT) attains excellent results compared to state-of-the-art convolutional networks while requiring substantially fewer computational resources to train.", "abstract_source": "openalex", "authors": ["Alexey Dosovitskiy", "Lucas Beyer", "Alexander Kolesnikov", "Dirk Weissenborn", "Xiaohua Zhai", "Thomas Unterthiner", "Mostafa Dehghani", "Matthias Minderer", "Georg Heigold", "Sylvain Gelly", "Jakob Uszkoreit", "Neil Houlsby"], "publish_year": 2020, "venue": "", "citation_count": 20747, "fields_of_study": ["Artificial intelligence", "Computer science", "Computer vision", "Engineering", "Cartography", "Electrical engineering", "Geography"], "url": "https://openalex.org/W3094502228"}

With recent advances in deep learning and computer vision there has been promising progress in the fields of motion and gesture recognition using deep learning and computer vision based techniques.

By basing decision-making algorithms on Deep Neural Networks, prejudice and unfairness may be promoted unknowingly due to a lack of transparency. Hence, several so-called explanators, or explainers, have been developed. Explainers try to give insight into the inner structure of machine learning black boxes by analyzing the connection between the input and output.

Challenges in adapting Transformer from language to vision arise from differences between the two domains, such as large variations in the scale of visual entities and the high resolution of pixels in images compared to words in text. To address these differences, we propose a hierarchical Transformer whose representation is computed with Shifted windows. The shifted windowing scheme brings greater efficiency by limiting self-attention computation to non-overlapping local windows while also allowing for cross-window connection. This hierarchical architecture has the flexibility to model at various scales and has linear computational complexity with respect to image size. These qualities of Swin Transformer make it compatible with a broad range of vision tasks, including image classification (87.3 top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K) and dense prediction tasks such as object detection (58.7 box AP and 51.1 mask AP on COCO test-dev) and semantic segmentation (53.5 mIoU on ADE20K val). Its performance surpasses the previous state-of-the-art by a large margin of +2.7 box AP and +2.6 mask AP on COCO, and +3.2 mIoU on ADE20K, demonstrating the potential of Transformer-based models as vision backbones.

Objectives: To determine the prevalence of CVS symptoms, knowledge and practices of computer use in students studying in different universities in Malaysia, and to evaluate the association of various factors in computer use with the occurrence of symptoms. Material and methods: In a cross sectional, questionnaire survey study, data was collected in college students regarding the demography, use of spectacles, duration of daily continuous use of computer, symptoms of CVS, preventive measures taken to reduce the symptoms, use of radiation filter on the computer screen, and lighting in the room. Results: A total of 795 students, aged between 18 and 25 years, from five universities in Malaysia were surveyed. The prevalence of symptoms of CVS (one or more) was found to be 89.9%; the most disturbing symptom was headache (19.7%) followed by eye strain (16.4%). Students who used computer for more than 2 hours per day experienced significantly more symptoms of CVS (p=0.0001). Looking at far objects in-between the work was significantly (p=0.0008) associated with less frequency of CVS symptoms. The use of radiation filter on the screen (p=0.6777) did not help in reducing the CVS symptoms. Conclusion: Ninety percent of university students in Malaysia experienced symptoms related to CVS, which was seen more often in those who used computer for more than 2 hours continuously per day.

This paper presents a new approach to GUI testing using computer vision for testers to automate their tasks. Testers can write a visual test script that uses images to specify which GUI components to interact with and what visual feedback to be observed. Testers can also generate visual test scripts by demonstration. By recording both input events and screen images, it is possible to extract the images of components interacted with and the visual feedback seen by the demonstrator, and generate a visual test script automatically. We show that a variety of GUI behavior can be tested using this approach. Also, we show how this approach can facilitate good testing practices such as unit testing, regression testing, and test-driven development.", "abstract_source": "openalex", "authors": ["Tsung-Hsiang Chang", "Tom Yeh", "Robert C.

It is recommended to predict the plant diseases at their early stage in the field of agriculture is essential to cater the food to the overall population. But it unfortunate to predict the diseases at the early stage of the crops. The idea behind the paper is to bring awareness amongst the farmers about the cutting-edge technologies to reduces diseases in plant leaf. Since tomato is merely available vegetable, the approaches of machine learning and image processing with an accurate algorithm is identified to detect the leaf diseases in the tomato plant. In this investigation, the samples of tomato leaves having disorders are considered. With these disorder samples of tomato leaves, the farmers will easily find the diseases based on the early symptoms. Firstly, the samples of tomato leaves are resized to 256 × 256 pixels and then Histogram Equalization is used to improve the quality of tomato samples. The K-means clustering is introduced for partitioning of dataspace into Voronoi cells. The boundary of leaf samples is extracted using contour tracing. The multiple descriptors viz., Discrete Wavelet Transform, Principal Component Analysis and Grey Level Co-occurrence Matrix are used to extract the informative features of the leaf samples. Finally, the extracted features are classified using machine learning approaches such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and K-Nearest Neighbor (K-NN).

Machine learning is automating human assistance by training an algorithm on relevant data. Supervised, Unsupervised, and Reinforcement Learning are the three fundamental categories of machine learning techniques. In this paper, we have discussed the different learning styles used in the field of Computer vision, Deep Learning, Neural networks, and machine learning. Some of the most recent applications of machine learning in computer vision include object identification, object classification, and extracting usable information from images, graphic documents, and videos. Some machine learning techniques frequently include zero-shot learning, active learning, contrastive learning, self-supervised learning, life-long learning, semi-supervised learning, ensemble learning, sequential learning, and multi-view learning used in computer vision until now. There is a lack of systematic reviews about all learning styles. This paper presents literature analysis of how different machine learning styles evolved in the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) for computer vision.

However, model-based annotations in large-scale applications may propagate errors or biases. To address these issues, our paper introduces StreamBased Active Distillation (SBAD) to endow pretrained students with effective and efficient finetuning methods that are robust to teacher imperfections. The proposed pipeline: (i) adapts a pretrained student model to a specific use case, based on a set of frames whose pseudo-labels are predicted by the teacher, and (ii) selects on-the-fly, along a streamed video, the images that should be considered to fine-tune the student model.

Compared with traditional machine learning algorithms, GAN works via adversarial training concept and is more powerful in both feature learning and representation. GAN also exhibits some problems, such as non-convergence, model collapse, and uncontrollability due to high degree of freedom. How to improve the theory of GAN and apply it to computer-vision-related tasks have now attracted much research efforts. In this paper, recently proposed GAN models and their applications in computer vision are systematically reviewed. In particular, we firstly survey the history and development of generative algorithms, the mechanism of GAN, its fundamental network structures, and theoretical analysis of the original GAN. Classical GAN algorithms are then compared comprehensively in terms of the mechanism, visual results of generated samples, and Frechet Inception Distance. These networks are further evaluated from network construction, performance, and applicability aspects by extensive experiments conducted over public datasets. After that, several typical applications of GAN in computer vision, including high-quality samples generation, style transfer, and image translation, are examined. Finally, some existing problems of GAN are summarized and discussed and potential future research topics are forecasted.", "abstract_source": "openalex", "authors": ["Yangjie Cao", "Lili Jia", "Yong-Xia Chen", "Nan Lin", "Yang Cong", "Bo Zhang", "Zhi Liu", "Xuexiang Li", "Honghua Dai"], "publish_year": 2018, "venue": "", "citation_count": 187, "fields_of_study": ["Computer science", "Artificial intelligence"], "url": "https://openalex.org/W2904843110"}

To use these models to perform prediction tasks, the original input x is modified using a template into a textual string prompt x′ that has some unfilled slots, and then the language model is used to probabilistically fill the unfilled information to obtain a final string x̂ , from which the final output y can be derived. This framework is powerful and attractive for a number of reasons: It allows the language model to be pre-trained on massive amounts of raw text, and by defining a new prompting function the model is able to perform few-shot or even zero-shot learning, adapting to new scenarios with few or no labeled data. In this article, we introduce the basics of this promising paradigm, describe a unified set of mathematical notations that can cover a wide variety of existing work, and organize existing work along several dimensions, e.g., the choice of pre-trained language models, prompts, and tuning strategies.

However, most pretraining efforts focus on general domain corpora, such as newswire and Web. A prevailing assumption is that even domain-specific pretraining can benefit by starting from general-domain language models. In this article, we challenge this assumption by showing that for domains with abundant unlabeled text, such as biomedicine, pretraining language models from scratch results in substantial gains over continual pretraining of general-domain language models. To facilitate this investigation, we compile a comprehensive biomedical NLP benchmark from publicly available datasets. Our experiments show that domain-specific pretraining serves as a solid foundation for a wide range of biomedical NLP tasks, leading to new state-of-the-art results across the board. Further, in conducting a thorough evaluation of modeling choices, both for pretraining and task-specific fine-tuning, we discover that some common practices are unnecessary with BERT models, such as using complex tagging schemes in named entity recognition.

The purpose of this article is to describe some of these challenges and to present some solutions that would guide current and future practitioners in the field of Arabic natural language processing (ANLP). We begin with general features of the Arabic language in Sections 1, 2, and 3 and then we move to more specific properties of the language in the rest of the article. In Section 1 of this article we highlight the significance of the Arabic language today and describe its general properties. Section 2 presents the feature of Arabic Diglossia showing how the sociolinguistic aspects of the Arabic language differ from other languages. The stability of Arabic Diglossia and its implications for ANLP applications are discussed and ways to deal with this problematic property are proposed. Section 3 deals with the properties of the Arabic script and the explosion of ambiguity that results from the absence of short vowel representations and overt case markers in contemporary Arabic texts. We present in Section 4 specific features of the Arabic language such as the nonconcatenative property of Arabic morphology, Arabic as an agglutinative language, Arabic as a pro-drop language, and the challenge these properties pose to ANLP. We also present solutions that have already been adopted by some pioneering researchers in the field. In Section 5 we point out to the lack of formal and explicit grammars of Modern Standard Arabic which impedes the progress of more advanced ANLP systems. In Section 6 we draw our conclusion.", "abstract_source": "openalex", "authors": ["Ali Farghaly", "Khaled Shaalan"], "publish_year": 2009, "venue": "", "citation_count": 521, "fields_of_study": ["Computer science", "Linguistics", "Natural language processing", "Artificial intelligence", "Philosophy", "Operating system"], "url": "https://openalex.org/W1984708705"}

This approach requires a large number of training examples and performs best for well-defined and narrow tasks. Transfer learning refers to a set of methods that extend this approach by leveraging data from additional domains or tasks to train a model with better generalization properties. Over the last two years, the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) has witnessed the emergence of several transfer learning methods and architectures which significantly improved upon the state-of-the-art on a wide range of NLP tasks. These improvements together with the wide availability and ease of integration of these methods are reminiscent of the factors that led to the success of pretrained word embeddings and ImageNet pretraining in computer vision, and indicate that these methods will likely become a common tool in the NLP landscape as well as an important research direction. We will present an overview of modern transfer learning methods in NLP, how models are pre-trained, what information the representations they learn capture, and review examples and case studies on how these models can be integrated and adapted in downstream NLP tasks.", "abstract_source": "openalex", "authors": ["Sebastian Ruder", "Matthew E.

Although radiology reports are stored for communication and documentation of diagnostic imaging, harnessing their potential requires efficient and automated information extraction: they exist mainly as free-text clinical narrative, from which it is a major challenge to obtain structured data. Natural language processing (NLP) provides techniques that aid the conversion of text into a structured representation, and thus enables computers to derive meaning from human (ie, natural language) input. Used on radiology reports, NLP techniques enable automatic identification and extraction of information. By exploring the various purposes for their use, this review examines how radiology benefits from NLP. A systematic literature search identified 67 relevant publications describing NLP methods that support practical applications in radiology. This review takes a close look at the individual studies in terms of tasks (ie, the extracted information), the NLP methodology and tools used, and their application purpose and performance results.

This can be useful, for both lawyers and judges, as an assisting tool to rapidly identify cases and extract patterns which lead to certain decisions. This paper presents the first systematic study on predicting the outcome of cases tried by the European Court of Human Rights based solely on textual content. We formulate a binary classification task where the input of our classifiers is the textual content extracted from a case and the target output is the actual judgment as to whether there has been a violation of an article of the convention of human rights. Textual information is represented using contiguous word sequences, i.e., N-grams, and topics. Our models can predict the court’s decisions with a strong accuracy (79% on average). Our empirical analysis indicates that the formal facts of a case are the most important predictive factor. This is consistent with the theory of legal realism suggesting that judicial decision-making is significantly affected by the stimulus of the facts. We also observe that the topical content of a case is another important feature in this classification task and explore this relationship further by conducting a qualitative analysis.", "abstract_source": "openalex", "authors": ["Νικόλαος Αλέτρας", "Dimitrios Tsarapatsanis", "Daniel Preoțiuc-Pietro", "Vasileios Lampos"], "publish_year": 2016, "venue": "", "citation_count": 703, "fields_of_study": ["Computer science", "Natural language processing", "Artificial intelligence", "Machine learning", "Law", "Political science", "Management", "Economics"], "url": "https://openalex.org/W2536769020"}

For every death by suicide, an estimated 138 people’s lives are meaningfully affected, and almost any other statistic around suicide deaths is equally alarming. The pervasiveness of social media—and the near-ubiquity of mobile devices used to access social media networks—offers new types of data for understanding the behavior of those who (attempt to) take their own lives and suggests new possibilities for preventive intervention. We demonstrate the feasibility of using social media data to detect those at risk for suicide. Specifically, we use natural language processing and machine learning (specifically deep learning) techniques to detect quantifiable signals around suicide attempts, and describe designs for an automated system for estimating suicide risk, usable by those without specialized mental health training (eg, a primary care doctor). We also discuss the ethical use of such technology and examine privacy implications. Currently, this technology is only used for intervention for individuals who have “opted in” for the analysis and intervention, but the technology enables scalable screening for suicide risk, potentially identifying many people who are at risk preventively and prior to any engagement with a health care system. This raises a significant cultural question about the trade-off between privacy and prevention—we have potentially life-saving technology that is currently reaching only a fraction of the possible people at risk because of respect for their privacy.

Natural language processing (NLP), by using corpora and learning approaches, provides good performance in statistical tasks, such as text classification or sentiment mining. Objective The primary aim of this systematic review was to summarize and characterize, in methodological and technical terms, studies that used machine learning and NLP techniques for mental health. The secondary aim was to consider the potential use of these methods in mental health clinical practice Methods This systematic review follows the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-analysis) guidelines and is registered with PROSPERO (Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews; number CRD42019107376). The search was conducted using 4 medical databases (PubMed, Scopus, ScienceDirect, and PsycINFO) with the following keywords: machine learning, data mining, psychiatry, mental health, and mental disorder. The exclusion criteria were as follows: languages other than English, anonymization process, case studies, conference papers, and reviews. No limitations on publication dates were imposed. Results A total of 327 articles were identified, of which 269 (82.3%) were excluded and 58 (17.7%) were included in the review. The results were organized through a qualitative perspective. Although studies had heterogeneous topics and methods, some themes emerged. Population studies could be grouped into 3 categories: patients included in medical databases, patients who came to the emergency room, and social media users. The main objectives were to extract symptoms, classify severity of illness, compare therapy effectiveness, provide psychopathological clues, and challenge the current nosography. Medical records and social media were the 2 major data sources. With regard to the methods used, preprocessing used the standard methods of NLP and unique identifier extraction dedicated to medical texts. Efficient classifiers were preferred rather than transparent functioning classifiers. Python was the most frequently used platform. Conclusions Machine learning and NLP models have been highly topical issues in medicine in recent years and may be considered a new paradigm in medical research. However, these processes tend to confirm clinical hypotheses rather than developing entirely new information, and only one major category of the population (ie, social media users) is an imprecise cohort. Moreover, some language-specific features can improve the performance of NLP methods, and their extension to other languages should be more closely investigated. However, machine learning and NLP techniques provide useful information from unexplored data (ie, patients’ daily habits that are usually inaccessible to care providers). Before considering It as an additional tool of mental health care, ethical issues remain and should be discussed in a timely manner.

Materials and Methods We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, Scopus, the Association for Computing Machinery Digital Library, and the Association for Computational Linguistics Anthology for articles using DL-based approaches to NLP problems in electronic health records. After screening 1,737 articles, we collected data on 25 variables across 212 papers. Results DL in clinical NLP publications more than doubled each year, through 2018. Recurrent neural networks (60.8%) and word2vec embeddings (74.1%) were the most popular methods; the information extraction tasks of text classification, named entity recognition, and relation extraction were dominant (89.2%). However, there was a “long tail” of other methods and specific tasks. Most contributions were methodological variants or applications, but 20.8% were new methods of some kind. The earliest adopters were in the NLP community, but the medical informatics community was the most prolific. Discussion Our analysis shows growing acceptance of deep learning as a baseline for NLP research, and of DL-based NLP in the medical community. A number of common associations were substantiated (eg, the preference of recurrent neural networks for sequence-labeling named entity recognition), while others were surprisingly nuanced (eg, the scarcity of French language clinical NLP with deep learning).

Unlike traditional supervised learning, which trains a model to take in an input x and predict an output y as P(y|x), prompt-based learning is based on language models that model the probability of text directly. To use these models to perform prediction tasks, the original input x is modified using a template into a textual string prompt x' that has some unfilled slots, and then the language model is used to probabilistically fill the unfilled information to obtain a final string x, from which the final output y can be derived. This framework is powerful and attractive for a number of reasons: it allows the language model to be pre-trained on massive amounts of raw text, and by defining a new prompting function the model is able to perform few-shot or even zero-shot learning, adapting to new scenarios with few or no labeled data. In this paper we introduce the basics of this promising paradigm, describe a unified set of mathematical notations that can cover a wide variety of existing work, and organize existing work along several dimensions, e.g.the choice of pre-trained models, prompts, and tuning strategies. To make the field more accessible to interested beginners, we not only make a systematic review of existing works and a highly structured typology of prompt-based concepts, but also release other resources, e.g., a website http://pretrain.nlpedia.ai/ including constantly-updated survey, and paperlist.", "abstract_source": "openalex", "authors": ["Pengfei Liu", "Weizhe Yuan", "Jinlan Fu", "Zhengbao Jiang", "Hiroaki Hayashi", "Graham Neubig"], "publish_year": 2021, "venue": "", "citation_count": 510, "fields_of_study": ["Computer science", "Artificial intelligence", "Natural language processing", "Programming language", "Linguistics", "Pure mathematics", "Mechanical engineering", "Philosophy", "Quantum mechanics", "Evolutionary biology", "Physics", "Biology", "Engineering", "Mathematics"], "url": "https://openalex.org/W4297801719"}

However, previous efforts have shown that DNNs are vulnerable to strategically modified samples, named adversarial examples . These samples are generated with some imperceptible perturbations, but can fool the DNNs to give false predictions. Inspired by the popularity of generating adversarial examples against DNNs in Computer Vision (CV), research efforts on attacking DNNs for Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications have emerged in recent years. However, the intrinsic difference between image (CV) and text (NLP) renders challenges to directly apply attacking methods in CV to NLP. Various methods are proposed addressing this difference and attack a wide range of NLP applications. In this article, we present a systematic survey on these works. We collect all related academic works since the first appearance in 2017. We then select, summarize, discuss, and analyze 40 representative works in a comprehensive way. To make the article self-contained, we cover preliminary knowledge of NLP and discuss related seminal works in computer vision.

This article reports on a mapping study that surveys the landscape of NLP4RE research to provide a holistic understanding of the field. Following the guidance of systematic review, the mapping study is directed by five research questions, cutting across five aspects of NLP4RE research, concerning the state of the literature, the state of empirical research, the research focus, the state of tool development, and the usage of NLP technologies. Our main results are as follows: (i) we identify a total of 404 primary studies relevant to NLP4RE, which were published over the past 36 years and from 170 different venues; (ii) most of these studies (67.08%) are solution proposals, assessed by a laboratory experiment or an example application, while only a small percentage (7%) are assessed in industrial settings; (iii) a large proportion of the studies (42.70%) focus on the requirements analysis phase, with quality defect detection as their central task and requirements specification as their commonly processed document type; (iv) 130 NLP4RE tools (i.e., RE specific NLP tools) are extracted from these studies, but only 17 of them (13.08%) are available for download; (v) 231 different NLP technologies are also identified, comprising 140 NLP techniques, 66 NLP tools, and 25 NLP resources, but most of them—particularly those novel NLP techniques and specialized tools—are used infrequently; by contrast, commonly used NLP technologies are traditional analysis techniques (e.g., POS tagging and tokenization), general-purpose tools (e.g., Stanford CoreNLP and GATE) and generic language lexicons (WordNet and British National Corpus). The mapping study not only provides a collection of the literature in NLP4RE but also, more importantly, establishes a structure to frame the existing literature through categorization, synthesis and conceptualization of the main theoretical concepts and relationships that encompass both RE and NLP aspects. Our work thus produces a conceptual framework of NLP4RE. The framework is used to identify research gaps and directions, highlight technology transfer needs, and encourage more synergies between the RE community, the NLP one, and the software and systems practitioners.

However, what drives this similarity remains currently unknown. Here, we systematically compare a variety of deep language models to identify the computational principles that lead them to generate brain-like representations of sentences. Specifically, we analyze the brain responses to 400 isolated sentences in a large cohort of 102 subjects, each recorded for two hours with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and magnetoencephalography (MEG). We then test where and when each of these algorithms maps onto the brain responses. Finally, we estimate how the architecture, training, and performance of these models independently account for the generation of brain-like representations. Our analyses reveal two main findings. First, the similarity between the algorithms and the brain primarily depends on their ability to predict words from context. Second, this similarity reveals the rise and maintenance of perceptual, lexical, and compositional representations within each cortical region. Overall, this study shows that modern language algorithms partially converge towards brain-like solutions, and thus delineates a promising path to unravel the foundations of natural language processing.", "abstract_source": "openalex", "authors": ["Charlotte Caucheteux", "Jean-Rémi King"], "publish_year": 2022, "venue": "", "citation_count": 281, "fields_of_study": ["Computer science", "Algorithm", "History", "Archaeology"], "url": "https://openalex.org/W4212828284"}

This paper provides a taxonomy of data sources and techniques that have been used for mental health support and intervention. Specifically, we review how social media and other data sources have been used to detect emotions and identify people who may be in need of psychological assistance; the computational techniques used in labeling and diagnosis; and finally, we discuss ways to generate and personalize mental health interventions.

Data in materials science are particularly heterogeneous, based on the significant range in materials classes that are explored and the variety of materials properties that are of interest. This leads to data that range many orders of magnitude, and these data may manifest as numerical text or image-based information, which requires quantitative interpretation. The ability to automatically consume and codify the scientific literature across domains—enabled by techniques adapted from the field of natural language processing—therefore has immense potential to unlock and generate the rich datasets necessary for data science and machine learning. This review focuses on the progress and practices of natural language processing and text mining of materials science literature and highlights opportunities for extracting additional information beyond text contained in figures and tables in articles. We discuss and provide examples for several reasons for the pursuit of natural language processing for materials, including data compilation, hypothesis development, and understanding the trends within and across fields.

Jacquemin's novel tool is FASTR, a parser that normalizes terms and recognizes term variants. Since there are more meanings in a language than there are words, FASTR uses a metagrammar composed of shallow transformations that describe the morphological, syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic variations of words and terms. The acquired parsed terms can then be applied for precise retrieval and assembly of information.The use of a corpus-based unification grammar to define, recognize, and combine term variants from their base forms allows for intelligent information access to, or linguistic data tuning of, heterogeneous texts. FASTR can be used to do automatic controlled indexing, to carry out content-based Web searches through conceptually related alternative query formulations, to abstract scientific and technical extracts, and even to translate and collect terms from multilingual material.

We aim to synthesize the literature on the use of NLP to process or analyze symptom information documented in EHR free-text narratives. Materials and Methods Our search of 1964 records from PubMed and EMBASE was narrowed to 27 eligible articles. Data related to the purpose, free-text corpus, patients, symptoms, NLP methodology, evaluation metrics, and quality indicators were extracted for each study. Results Symptom-related information was presented as a primary outcome in 14 studies. EHR narratives represented various inpatient and outpatient clinical specialties, with general, cardiology, and mental health occurring most frequently. Studies encompassed a wide variety of symptoms, including shortness of breath, pain, nausea, dizziness, disturbed sleep, constipation, and depressed mood. NLP approaches included previously developed NLP tools, classification methods, and manually curated rule-based processing. Only one-third (n = 9) of studies reported patient demographic characteristics. Discussion NLP is used to extract information from EHR free-text narratives written by a variety of healthcare providers on an expansive range of symptoms across diverse clinical specialties. The current focus of this field is on the development of methods to extract symptom information and the use of symptom information for disease classification tasks rather than the examination of symptoms themselves. Conclusion Future NLP studies should concentrate on the investigation of symptoms and symptom documentation in EHR free-text narratives. Efforts should be undertaken to examine patient characteristics and make symptom-related NLP algorithms or pipelines and vocabularies openly available.", "abstract_source": "openalex", "authors": ["Theresa A.

Given these capabilities, natural language processing is increasingly applied to new tasks, new domains, and new languages. Current models, however, are sensitive to noise and adversarial examples and prone to overfitting. This brittleness, together with the cost of attention, challenges the supervised learning paradigm. Transfer learning allows us to leverage knowledge acquired from related data in order to improve performance on a target task. Implicit transfer learning in the form of pretrained word representations has been a common component in natural language processing. In this dissertation, we argue that more explicit transfer learning is key to deal with the dearth of training data and to improve downstream performance of natural language processing models. We show experimental results transferring knowledge from related domains, tasks, and languages that support this hypothesis. We make several contributions to transfer learning for natural language processing: Firstly, we propose new methods to automatically select relevant data for supervised and unsupervised domain adaptation. Secondly, we propose two novel architectures that improve sharing in multi-task learning and outperform single-task learning as well as the state-of-the-art. Thirdly, we analyze the limitations of current models for unsupervised cross-lingual transfer and propose a method to mitigate them as well as a novel latent variable cross-lingual word embedding model. Finally, we propose a framework based on fine-tuning language models for sequential transfer learning and analyze the adaptation phase.", "abstract_source": "openalex", "authors": ["Sebastian Ruder"], "publish_year": 2019, "venue": "", "citation_count": 187, "fields_of_study": ["Computer science", "Natural language processing", "Artificial intelligence", "Geography", "Archaeology"], "url": "https://openalex.org/W2979736514"}

Design: An adverse event detection system for discharge summaries using the NLP system MedLEE was constructed to identify 45 NYPORTS event types. The system was first applied to a random sample of 1,000 manually reviewed charts. The system then processed all inpatient cases with electronic discharge summaries for two years. All system-identified events were reviewed, and performance was compared with traditional reporting. Measurements: System sensitivity, specificity, and predictive value, with manual review serving as the gold standard. Results: The system correctly identified 16 of 65 events in 1,000 charts. Of 57,452 total electronic discharge summaries, the system identified 1,590 events in 1,461 cases, and manual review verified 704 events in 652 cases, resulting in an overall sensitivity of 0.28 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.17–0.42), specificity of 0.985 (CI: 0.984–0.986), and positive predictive value of 0.45 (CI: 0.42–0.47) for detecting cases with events and an average specificity of 0.9996 (CI: 0.9996–0.9997) per event type. Traditional event reporting detected 322 events during the period (sensitivity 0.09), of which the system identified 110 as well as 594 additional events missed by traditional methods.

A number of information extraction systems for the biomedical domain have been reported, but none of them have become widely used in practical applications. Most proposals to date make rather simplistic assumptions about the syntactic aspect of natural language. There is an urgent need for a system that has broad coverage and performs well in real-text applications. Results: We present a general biomedical domain-oriented NLP engine called MedScan that efficiently processes sentences from MEDLINE abstracts and produces a set of regularized logical structures representing the meaning of each sentence. The engine utilizes a specially developed context-free grammar and lexicon. Preliminary evaluation of the system's performance, accuracy, and coverage exhibited encouraging results. Further approaches for increasing the coverage and reducing parsing ambiguity of the engine, as well as its application for information extraction are discussed.

In the Emergency Department, where suicidal patients often present, estimating the risk of repeated attempts is generally left to clinical judgment. This paper presents our second attempt to determine the role of computational algorithms in understanding a suicidal patient's thoughts, as represented by suicide notes. We focus on developing methods of natural language processing that distinguish between genuine and elicited suicide notes. We hypothesize that machine learning algorithms can categorize suicide notes as well as mental health professionals and psychiatric physician trainees do. The data used are comprised of suicide notes from 33 suicide completers and matched to 33 elicited notes from healthy control group members. Eleven mental health professionals and 31 psychiatric trainees were asked to decide if a note was genuine or elicited. Their decisions were compared to nine different machine-learning algorithms. The results indicate that trainees accurately classified notes 49% of the time, mental health professionals accurately classified notes 63% of the time, and the best machine learning algorithm accurately classified the notes 78% of the time. This is an important step in developing an evidence-based predictor of repeated suicide attempts because it shows that natural language processing can aid in distinguishing between classes of suicidal notes.", "abstract_source": "openalex", "authors": ["John Pestian", "Henry A.

NLP-based computational phenotyping has numerous applications including diagnosis categorization, novel phenotype discovery, clinical trial screening, pharmacogenomics, drug-drug interaction (DDI), and adverse drug event (ADE) detection, as well as genome-wide and phenome-wide association studies. Significant progress has been made in algorithm development and resource construction for computational phenotyping. Among the surveyed methods, well-designed keyword search and rule-based systems often achieve good performance. However, the construction of keyword and rule lists requires significant manual effort, which is difficult to scale. Supervised machine learning models have been favored because they are capable of acquiring both classification patterns and structures from data. Recently, deep learning and unsupervised learning have received growing attention, with the former favored for its performance and the latter for its ability to find novel phenotypes. Integrating heterogeneous data sources have become increasingly important and have shown promise in improving model performance. Often, better performance is achieved by combining multiple modalities of information.

This has generated a lot of research interest in interpreting the representations learned by these networks. We propose here a novel interpretation approach that relies on the only processing system we have that does understand language: the human brain. We use brain imaging recordings of subjects reading complex natural text to interpret word and sequence embeddings from 4 recent NLP models - ELMo, USE, BERT and Transformer-XL. We study how their representations differ across layer depth, context length, and attention type. Our results reveal differences in the context-related representations across these models. Further, in the transformer models, we find an interaction between layer depth and context length, and between layer depth and attention type. We finally hypothesize that altering BERT to better align with brain recordings would enable it to also better understand language. Probing the altered BERT using syntactic NLP tasks reveals that the model with increased brain-alignment outperforms the original model.

To effectively \"mine\" these large datasets for hypothesis testing, a robust strategy for extracting the necessary information is needed. Manual extraction of information is a time-consuming and often unmanageable task. \"Intelligent\" search engines that instead rely on natural language processing (NLP), a computer-based approach to analyzing free-form text or speech, can be used to automate this data mining task.

For the majority of our tasks, we find that simple, unsupervised models perform better when n -gram counts are obtained from the Web rather than from a large corpus.

Using the DISCERN system as an example, he describes a general approach to building high-level cognitive models from distributed neural networks and shows how the special properties of such networks are useful in modeling human performance. In this approach connectionist networks are not only plausible models of isolated cognitive phenomena, but also sufficient constituents for complete artificial intelligence systems.Distributed neural networks have been very successful in modeling isolated cognitive phenomena, but complex high-level behavior has been tractable only with symbolic artificial intelligence techniques. Aiming to bridge this gap, Miikkulainen describes DISCERN, a complete natural language processing system implemented entirely at the subsymbolic level. In DISCERN, distributed neural network models of parsing, generating, reasoning, lexical processing, and episodic memory are integrated into a single system that learns to read, paraphrase, and answer questions about stereotypical narratives.Miikkulainen's work, which includes a comprehensive survey of the connectionist literature related to natural language processing, will prove especially valuable to researchers interested in practical techniques for high-level representation, inferencing, memory modeling, and modular connectionist architectures.

Yet valuable information is broadcast, and can provide useful insight into time- and safety-critical situations if captured and analyzed properly and rapidly. We describe an approach for automatically identifying messages communicated via Twitter that contribute to situational awareness, and explain why it is beneficial for those seeking information during mass emergencies.We collected Twitter messages from four different crisis events of varying nature and magnitude and built a classifier to automatically detect messages that may contribute to situational awareness, utilizing a combination of hand-annotated and automatically-extracted linguistic features. Our system was able to achieve over 80% accuracy on categorizing tweets that contribute to situational awareness. Additionally, we show that a classifier developed for a specific emergency event performs well on similar events.

Current pharmacovigilance systems still have substantial limitations, however. The objective of our work is to demonstrate the feasibility of using natural language processing (NLP), the comprehensive Electronic Health Record (EHR), and association statistics for pharmacovigilance purposes. DESIGN Narrative discharge summaries were collected from the Clinical Information System at New York Presbyterian Hospital (NYPH). MedLEE, an NLP system, was applied to the collection to identify medication events and entities which could be potential adverse drug events (ADEs). Co-occurrence statistics with adjusted volume tests were used to detect associations between the two types of entities, to calculate the strengths of the associations, and to determine their cutoff thresholds. Seven drugs/drug classes (ibuprofen, morphine, warfarin, bupropion, paroxetine, rosiglitazone, ACE inhibitors) with known ADEs were selected to evaluate the system. RESULTS One hundred thirty-two potential ADEs were found to be associated with the 7 drugs. Overall recall and precision were 0.75 and 0.31 for known ADEs respectively. Importantly, qualitative evaluation using historic roll back design suggested that novel ADEs could be detected using our system. CONCLUSIONS This study provides a framework for the development of active, high-throughput and prospective systems which could potentially unveil drug safety profiles throughout their entire market life. Our results demonstrate that the framework is feasible although there are some challenging issues.

The representations are developed automatically by all networks while they are learning their processing tasks. The resulting representations reflect the regularities in the subtasks, which facilitates robust processing in the face of noise and damage, supports improved generalization, and provides expectations about possible contexts. The lexicon can be extended by cloning new instances of the items, that is, by generating a number of items with known processing properties and distinct identities. This technique combinatorially increases the processing power of the system. The recurrent FGREP module, together with a central lexicon, is used as a basic building block in modeling higher level natural language tasks. A single module is used to form case-role representations of sentences from word-by-word sequential natural language input.

More recently, our work has shown that it is possible to detect technical debt using source code comments (i.e., self-admitted technical debt), and that the most common types of self-admitted technical debt are design and requirement debt. However, all approaches thus far heavily depend on the manual classification of source code comments. In this paper, we present an approach to automatically identify design and requirement self-admitted technical debt using Natural Language Processing (NLP). We study 10 open source projects: Ant, ArgoUML, Columba, EMF, Hibernate, JEdit, JFreeChart, JMeter, JRuby and SQuirrel SQL and find that 1) we are able to accurately identify self-admitted technical debt, significantly outperforming the current state-of-the-art based on fixed keywords and phrases; 2) words related to sloppy code or mediocre source code quality are the best indicators of design debt, whereas words related to the need to complete a partially implemented requirement in the future are the best indicators of requirement debt; and 3) we can achieve 90 percent of the best classification performance, using as little as 23 percent of the comments for both design and requirement self-admitted technical debt, and 80 percent of the best performance, using as little as 9 and 5 percent of the comments for design and requirement self-admitted technical debt, respectively.

However, despite its critical role in the life and social sciences, causality has not had the same importance in Natural Language Processing (NLP), which has traditionally placed more emphasis on predictive tasks. This distinction is beginning to fade, with an emerging area of interdisciplinary research at the convergence of causal inference and language processing. Still, research on causality in NLP remains scattered across domains without unified definitions, benchmark datasets and clear articulations of the challenges and opportunities in the application of causal inference to the textual domain, with its unique properties. In this survey, we consolidate research across academic areas and situate it in the broader NLP landscape. We introduce the statistical challenge of estimating causal effects with text, encompassing settings where text is used as an outcome, treatment, or to address confounding. In addition, we explore potential uses of causal inference to improve the robustness, fairness, and interpretability of NLP models. We thus provide a unified overview of causal inference for the NLP community.1", "abstract_source": "openalex", "authors": ["Amir Feder", "Katherine A.

NLP attempts to address the inherent problem that while human communications are often ambiguous and imprecise, computers require unambiguous and precise messages to enable understanding. The accounting, auditing and finance domains frequently put forth textual documents intended to communicate a wide variety of messages, including, but not limited to, corporate financial performance, management's assessment of current and future firm performance, analysts’ assessments of firm performance, domain standards and regulations as well as evidence of compliance with relevant standards and regulations. NLP applications have been used to mine these documents to obtain insights, make inferences and to create additional methodologies and artefacts to advance knowledge in accounting, auditing and finance.

Deep-level grammatical and semantic analysis usually uses words as the basic unit, and word segmentation is usually the primary task of NLP. In order to solve the practical problem of huge structural differences between different data modalities in a multi-modal environment and traditional machine learning methods cannot be directly applied, this paper introduces the feature extraction method of deep learning and applies the ideas of deep learning to multi-modal feature extraction. This paper proposes a multi-modal neural network. For each mode, there is a multilayer sub-neural network with an independent structure corresponding to it. It is used to convert the features in different modes to the same-modal features. In terms of word segmentation processing, in view of the problems that existing word segmentation methods can hardly guarantee long-term dependency of text semantics and long training prediction time, a hybrid network English word segmentation processing method is proposed. This method applies BI-GRU (Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit) to English word segmentation, and uses the CRF (Conditional Random Field) model to annotate sentences in sequence, effectively solving the long-distance dependency of text semantics, shortening network training and predicted time. Experiments show that the processing effect of this method on word segmentation is similar to that of BI-LSTM-CRF (Bidirectional- Long Short Term Memory-Conditional Random Field) model, but the average predicted processing speed is 1.94 times that of BI-LSTM-CRF, effectively improving the efficiency of word segmentation processing.", "abstract_source": "openalex", "authors": ["Dongyang Wang", "Junli Su", "Hongbin Yu"], "publish_year": 2020, "venue": "", "citation_count": 161, "fields_of_study": ["Computer science", "Artificial intelligence", "Natural language processing", "Speech recognition", "Chemistry", "Polymer chemistry", "Philosophy", "Management", "Programming language", "Economics", "Linguistics"], "url": "https://openalex.org/W3006156918"}

More specificall~ it is devoted to possible applications to, and further dedicated development of, the accumulated considerable resources in NLP for, IAS. The expected and partially accomplished result is in harnessing the weird, illogical ways natural languages encode meaning, the very ways that defy all the usual combinatorial approaches to mathematical--and computational--complexity and make NLP so hard, to enhance information security. The paper is of a mixed theoretical and empirical nature. Of the four possible venues of applications, (i) memorizing randomly generated passwords with the help of automatically generated funny jingles, (ii) natural language watermarking, (iii) using the available machine translation (MT) systems for (additional) encryption of text messages, and (iv) downgrading, or sanitizing classified information in networks, two venues, (i) and (iv), have been at least partially implemented and the remaining two (ii) and (iii) are being implemented to the proof-of-concept level. We must make it very clear, however, that we have done very little experimentation or evaluation at this point, though we are moving quickly in that direction. The merits of the paper, if any, are in its venture to make considerable progress achieved recently in NLE especially in knowledge representation and meaning analysis, useful for IAS needs. The NLP approach adopted here, ontological semantics, has been developed by two of the coauthors; watermarking is based on the pioneering research by another coauthor and his associates; most of the implementation of the password memorization software has been done by the fourth coauthor. All the four of us have agonized whether we should report this research now or wait till we have fully implemented all or at least some of the systems we are developing. At the end of the day, we have reached a consensus that it is important, even at this early stage, to review for the information security community what NLP can do for it and to invite feedback and further efforts and ideas on what seems likely to become a new paradigm in information security.

The symptoms or characteristics of illness course necessary to develop reliable predictors are not available in coded billing data, but may be present in narrative electronic health record (EHR) discharge summaries. We identified a cohort of individuals admitted to a psychiatric inpatient unit between 1994 and 2012 with a principal diagnosis of major depressive disorder, and extracted inpatient psychiatric discharge narrative notes. Using these data, we trained a 75-topic Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model, a form of natural language processing, which identifies groups of words associated with topics discussed in a document collection. The cohort was randomly split to derive a training (70%) and testing (30%) data set, and we trained separate support vector machine models for baseline clinical features alone, baseline features plus common individual words and the above plus topics identified from the 75-topic LDA model. Of 4687 patients with inpatient discharge summaries, 470 were readmitted within 30 days. The 75-topic LDA model included topics linked to psychiatric symptoms (suicide, severe depression, anxiety, trauma, eating/weight and panic) and major depressive disorder comorbidities (infection, postpartum, brain tumor, diarrhea and pulmonary disease). By including LDA topics, prediction of readmission, as measured by area under receiver-operating characteristic curves in the testing data set, was improved from baseline (area under the curve 0.618) to baseline+1000 words (0.682) to baseline+75 topics (0.784). Inclusion of topics derived from narrative notes allows more accurate discrimination of individuals at high risk for psychiatric readmission in this cohort.

Objective The aim of this study is to leverage natural language processing (NLP) with the goal of characterizing changes in 15 of the world’s largest mental health support groups (eg, r/schizophrenia, r/SuicideWatch, r/Depression) found on the website Reddit, along with 11 non–mental health groups (eg, r/PersonalFinance, r/conspiracy) during the initial stage of the pandemic. Methods We created and released the Reddit Mental Health Dataset including posts from 826,961 unique users from 2018 to 2020. Using regression, we analyzed trends from 90 text-derived features such as sentiment analysis, personal pronouns, and semantic categories. Using supervised machine learning, we classified posts into their respective support groups and interpreted important features to understand how different problems manifest in language. We applied unsupervised methods such as topic modeling and unsupervised clustering to uncover concerns throughout Reddit before and during the pandemic. Results We found that the r/HealthAnxiety forum showed spikes in posts about COVID-19 early on in January, approximately 2 months before other support groups started posting about the pandemic. There were many features that significantly increased during COVID-19 for specific groups including the categories “economic stress,” “isolation,” and “home,” while others such as “motion” significantly decreased. We found that support groups related to attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, eating disorders, and anxiety showed the most negative semantic change during the pandemic out of all mental health groups. Health anxiety emerged as a general theme across Reddit through independent supervised and unsupervised machine learning analyses. For instance, we provide evidence that the concerns of a diverse set of individuals are converging in this unique moment of history; we discovered that the more users posted about COVID-19, the more linguistically similar (less distant) the mental health support groups became to r/HealthAnxiety (ρ=–0.96, P&lt;.001). Using unsupervised clustering, we found the suicidality and loneliness clusters more than doubled in the number of posts during the pandemic. Specifically, the support groups for borderline personality disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder became significantly associated with the suicidality cluster. Furthermore, clusters surrounding self-harm and entertainment emerged. Conclusions By using a broad set of NLP techniques and analyzing a baseline of prepandemic posts, we uncovered patterns of how specific mental health problems manifest in language, identified at-risk users, and revealed the distribution of concerns across Reddit, which could help provide better resources to its millions of users. We then demonstrated that textual analysis is sensitive to uncover mental health complaints as they appear in real time, identifying vulnerable groups and alarming themes during COVID-19, and thus may have utility during the ongoing pandemic and other world-changing events such as elections and protests.", "abstract_source": "openalex", "authors": ["Daniel M.

The system extracts, structures, and encodes clinical information from textual patient reports. It was integrated with the Clinical Information System (CIS), which was developed at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center (CPMC) to help improve patient care. MEDLEE is currently used on a daily basis to routinely process radiological reports of patients at CPMC. In order to describe how the natural language system was made compatible with the existing CIS, this paper will also discuss engineering issues which involve performance, robustness, and accessibility of the data from the end users' viewpoint. Also described are the three evaluations that have been performed on the system. The first evaluation was useful primarily for further refinement of the system. The two other evaluations involved an actual clinical application which consisted of retrieving reports that were associated with specified diseases. Automated queries were written by a medical expert based on the structured output forms generated as a result of text processing. The retrievals obtained by the automated system were compared to the retrievals obtained by independent medical experts who read the reports manually to determine whether they were associated with the specified diseases. MEDLEE was shown to perform comparably to the experts. The technique used to perform the last two evaluations was found to be a realistic evaluation technique for a natural language processor.", "abstract_source": "openalex", "authors": ["C Friedman", "George Hripcsak", "William DuMouchel", "Stephen B.

CT-BERT is specifically designed to be used on COVID-19 content, particularly from social media, and can be utilized for various natural language processing tasks such as classification, question-answering, and chatbots. This paper aims to evaluate the performance of CT-BERT on different classification datasets and compare it with BERT-LARGE, its base model. Methods The study utilizes CT-BERT, which is pre-trained on a large corpus of COVID-19 related Twitter messages. The authors evaluated the performance of CT-BERT on five different classification datasets, including one in the target domain. The model's performance is compared to its base model, BERT-LARGE, to measure the marginal improvement. The authors also provide detailed information on the training process and the technical specifications of the model. Results The results indicate that CT-BERT outperforms BERT-LARGE with a marginal improvement of 10-30% on all five classification datasets. The largest improvements are observed in the target domain. The authors provide detailed performance metrics and discuss the significance of these results. Discussion The study demonstrates the potential of pre-trained transformer models, such as CT-BERT, for COVID-19 related natural language processing tasks. The results indicate that CT-BERT can improve the classification performance on COVID-19 related content, especially on social media. These findings have important implications for various applications, such as monitoring public sentiment and developing chatbots to provide COVID-19 related information. The study also highlights the importance of using domain-specific pre-trained models for specific natural language processing tasks.

However, to be used in a therapy, their life cycle should be strictly lytic. With the growing popularity of Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) technology, it is possible to gain such information from the genome sequence. A number of tools are available which help to define phage life cycle. However, there is still no unanimous way to deal with this problem, especially in the absence of well-defined open reading frames. To overcome this limitation, a new tool is definitely needed. Results We developed a novel tool, called PhageAI, that allows to access more than 10 000 publicly available bacteriophages and differentiate between their major types of life cycles: lytic and lysogenic. The tool included life cycle classifier which achieved 98.90% accuracy on a validation set and 97.18% average accuracy on a test set. We adopted nucleotide sequences embedding based on the Word2Vec with Ship-gram model and linear Support Vector Machine with 10-fold cross-validation for supervised classification. PhageAI is free of charge and it is available at https://phage.ai/ . PhageAI is a REST web service and available as Python package. Conclusions Machine learning and Natural Language Processing allows to extract information from bacteriophages nucleotide sequences for lifecycle prediction tasks. The PhageAI tool classifies phages into either virulent or temperate with a higher accuracy than any existing methods and shares interactive 3D visualization to help interpreting model classification results.", "abstract_source": "openalex", "authors": ["Piotr Tynecki", "Arkadiusz Guziński", "Joanna Kazimierczak", "Michał Jadczuk", "Jarosław Dastych", "Agnieszka Oniśko"], "publish_year": 2020, "venue": "", "citation_count": 156, "fields_of_study": ["Computer science", "Artificial intelligence", "Machine learning", "Biology", "Virology"], "url": "https://openalex.org/W3041773305"}

They are: a Natural Language Analyser, a Conceptual Graphs Builder, a Data Base Storage component, a Query Processor, a Natural Language Generator and, in addition, a Translator, a Diagnosis Encoding System and a Literature Indexing System. Taking advantage of a closed domain of knowledge, defined around a medical specialty, a method called proximity processing has been developed.

To serve the functions it is designed for, the problem list has to be as accurate and timely as possible. However, the current problem list is usually incomplete and inaccurate, and is often totally unused. To alleviate this issue, we are building an environment where the problem list can be easily and effectively maintained. Methods For this project, 80 medical problems were selected for their frequency of use in our future clinical field of evaluation (cardiovascular). We have developed an Automated Problem List system composed of two main components: a background and a foreground application. The background application uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to harvest potential problem list entries from the list of 80 targeted problems detected in the multiple free-text electronic documents available in our electronic medical record. These proposed medical problems drive the foreground application designed for management of the problem list. Within this application, the extracted problems are proposed to the physicians for addition to the official problem list. Results The set of 80 targeted medical problems selected for this project covered about 5% of all possible diagnoses coded in ICD-9-CM in our study population (cardiovascular adult inpatients), but about 64% of all instances of these coded diagnoses. The system contains algorithms to detect first document sections, then sentences within these sections, and finally potential problems within the sentences. The initial evaluation of the section and sentence detection algorithms demonstrated a sensitivity and positive predictive value of 100% when detecting sections, and a sensitivity of 89% and a positive predictive value of 94% when detecting sentences. Conclusion The global aim of our project is to automate the process of creating and maintaining a problem list for hospitalized patients and thereby help to guarantee the timeliness, accuracy and completeness of this information.", "abstract_source": "openalex", "authors": ["Stéphane M.

Leveraging SDoH in clinical decision-making can potentially improve diagnosis, treatment planning, and patient outcomes. Despite increased interest in capturing SDoH in electronic health records (EHRs), such information is typically locked in unstructured clinical notes. Natural language processing (NLP) is the key technology to extract SDoH information from clinical text and expand its utility in patient care and research. This article presents a systematic review of the state-of-the-art NLP approaches and tools that focus on identifying and extracting SDoH data from unstructured clinical text in EHRs. Materials and Methods A broad literature search was conducted in February 2021 using 3 scholarly databases (ACL Anthology, PubMed, and Scopus) following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. A total of 6402 publications were initially identified, and after applying the study inclusion criteria, 82 publications were selected for the final review. Results Smoking status (n = 27), substance use (n = 21), homelessness (n = 20), and alcohol use (n = 15) are the most frequently studied SDoH categories. Homelessness (n = 7) and other less-studied SDoH (eg, education, financial problems, social isolation and support, family problems) are mostly identified using rule-based approaches. In contrast, machine learning approaches are popular for identifying smoking status (n = 13), substance use (n = 9), and alcohol use (n = 9).

However, because accident cases are recorded as unstructured text data, significant time and effort are required to retrieve and analyze the knowledge a user wants. To overcome these limitations, this research proposes a knowledge management system for construction accident cases using natural language processing. For this purpose, two models were developed that can retrieve appropriate cases according to user intentions and automatically analyze tacit knowledge from construction accident cases. In the retrieval model, the query is expanded using a construction accident case thesaurus. Ranking is calculated using Okapi BM25 and weighting according to the thesaurus. In the analysis model, knowledge is automatically extracted using rule-based and conditional random field (CRF) methods. The proposed system can retrieve results that are 97% relevant to the accident cases the user intended and can automatically analyze knowledge with accuracies of 93.75% and 84.13% for the rule-based and CRF models, respectively.

The approach taken is to integrate the parser with the rest of the system. This enables the parser to benefit from predictions that the rest of the system makes in the course of its processing.

Thus, there has been growing interest in the development of vision-based hand gesture recognition for HRI to bridge human-robot barriers. The aim is for interaction with robots to be as natural as that between individuals. Accordingly, incorporating hand gestures in HRI is a significant research area. Hand gestures can provide natural, intuitive, and creative methods for communicating with robots. This paper provides an analysis of hand gesture recognition using both monocular cameras and RGB-D cameras for this purpose. Specifically, the main process of visual gesture recognition includes data acquisition, hand gesture detection and segmentation, feature extraction and gesture classification, which are discussed in this paper. Experimental evaluations are also reviewed. Furthermore, algorithms of hand gesture recognition for human-robot interaction are examined in this study. In addition, the advances required for improvement in the present hand gesture recognition systems, which can be applied for effective and efficient human-robot interaction, are discussed.", "abstract_source": "openalex", "authors": ["Jing Qi", "Li Ma", "Zhenchao Cui", "Yushu Yu"], "publish_year": 2023, "venue": "", "citation_count": 158, "fields_of_study": ["Artificial intelligence", "Computer science", "Computer vision", "Human–computer interaction", "Linguistics", "Philosophy", "Operating system"], "url": "https://openalex.org/W4384822009"}

However, recent trends in the BCI and neurofeedback research highlight passive monitoring of a user's brain activity in order to estimate cognitive load, attention level, perceived errors and emotions. Extraction of such higher order information from brain signals is seen as a gateway for facilitation of interaction between humans and intelligent systems. Particularly in the field of robotics, passive BCIs provide a promising channel for prediction of user's cognitive and affective state for development of a user-adaptive interaction. In this paper, we first illustrate the state of the art in passive BCI technology and then provide examples of BCI employment in human-robot interaction (HRI).

In particular, he hypothesized that a person's response to a humanlike robot would abruptly shift from empathy to revulsion as it approached, but failed to attain, a lifelike appearance. This descent into eeriness is known as the uncanny valley. The essay appeared in an obscure Japanese journal called Energy in 1970, and in subsequent years, it received almost no attention. However, more recently, the concept of the uncanny valley has rapidly attracted interest in robotics and other scientific circles as well as in popular culture. Some researchers have explored its implications for human-robot interaction and computer-graphics animation, whereas others have investigated its biological and social roots. Now interest in the uncanny valley should only intensify, as technology evolves and researchers build robots that look human.

This theory predicts that people are more likely to anthropomorphize when anthropocentric knowledge is accessible and applicable, when motivated to be effective social agents, and when lacking a sense of social connection to other humans. These factors help to explain why anthropomorphism is so variable; organize diverse research; and offer testable predictions about dispositional, situational, developmental, and cultural influences on anthropomorphism.

These limit the development of the SSVEP-BCI application system in complex and changeable scenarios. In this study, the SSVEP-BCI system integrated with augmented reality (AR) is proposed. Furthermore, a stimulation interface is made by merging the visual information of the objects with stimulus targets, which can update the mapping relationship between stimulus targets and objects automatically to adapt to the change of the objects in the workspace.

The aim is to systematically integrate autonomous mobile robots into open and distributed computer networks and their interface systems so as to integrate the information world of computers with the physical world of humans and robots. It seems that this approach is conceptually new to people both in computer science and in robotics. The author presents some fundamental problems in human-robot-computer interaction, following a brief summary of related work. Next, some results obtained in PRIME project are described, followed by concluding remarks.< <ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>", "abstract_source": "openalex", "authors": ["Y.

HCI is essential for creating robots that can be used in a variety of environments, from industry to home. Robots designed with good HCI can be more efficient and safer at work, which can increase productivity and reduce errors and accidents. Aim: to perform a bibliometric evaluation using Web of Science on Human-Computer Interaction in the Robotics field. Methods: a bibliometric study was conducted on Human-Computer Interaction in the field of Robotics using the Web of Science database. A total of 592 documents were recovered. Results: the number of published documents increased gradually from 2 in 1999 to a peak of 79 in 2019, but decreased in 2020 to 30 and in 2021 to 41. The number of received citations also increased over time, with a peak of 547 in 2015, and has decreased in subsequent years. China tops the list with 159 documents and 544 citations, but has a relatively low average citations per document (Cpd) of 3,42 and a total link strength of 8. In comparison, the United States has a much lower number of documents (71), but a much higher number of citations (1941) and a much higher Cpd of 27,34. During the analysis of the terms present in the articles, it can be observed that the term \"Human-Computer Interaction\" is the most commonly used, with a frequency of 124, indicating that it remains the most frequently used term to describe the discipline. Conclusions: the findings of this study suggest that Human-Computer Interaction in the field of robotics is an active and constantly evolving research area, with a focus on enhancing usability and user experience through various research techniques and theoretical approaches. These results may be useful for researchers and professionals interested in this field, as they provide valuable insights into recent trends and developments in the scientific literature.", "abstract_source": "openalex", "authors": ["Raghav Chandran"], "publish_year": 2022, "venue": "", "citation_count": 16, "fields_of_study": ["Artificial intelligence", "Computer science", "Data science", "Human–computer interaction", "Chemistry", "Biochemistry"], "url": "https://openalex.org/W4366967724"}

In the current study, we aimed to identify and characterize factors that influence post-stroke patients’ trust in a robot-operated and a computer-operated rehabilitation platform during and after a long-term experience with the platform. We conducted 29 interviews with 16 stroke patients who underwent a long-term rehabilitation process, assisted by either a SAR or a computer interface. The intervention lasted 5–7 weeks per patient, for a total of 229 sessions over 18 months. By using a qualitative research method—extended interviews “in the wild” with stroke patients, over a long-term rehabilitation process—our study reveals users’ perspectives regarding factors affecting trust in the SAR or in the computer interface during their rehabilitation process. The results support the assertion that SARs have an added value in the rehabilitative care of stroke patients; It appears that personal characteristics, such as age and gender, have an effect on the users’ acceptance of a non-human operator as a practice assistant. Our findings support the notion that SARs augment rehabilitative therapies beyond a standard computer; Importantly, patients appreciated different aspects of the non-human operator in the two groups: In the SAR group, users preferred its functional performance over its anthropomorphized social skills; In the Computer group, users highlighted its contribution to the training of their memory skills.", "abstract_source": "openalex", "authors": ["Yaacov Koren", "Ronit Feingold-Polak", "Shelly Levy‐Tzedek"], "publish_year": 2022, "venue": "", "citation_count": 21, "fields_of_study": ["Physical medicine and rehabilitation", "Artificial intelligence", "Human–computer interaction", "Computer science", "Psychology", "Medicine", "Physical therapy", "Engineering", "Physics", "Quantum mechanics", "Mechanical engineering"], "url": "https://openalex.org/W4296068972"}

They command robots on a factory floor, power generation in a power plant, processes in a chemical plant, and traffic lights in a city. These less visible computers are called embedded systems, and the software they run is called embedded software. The principal challenges in designing and analyzing embedded systems stem from their interaction with physical processes. This book takes a cyber-physical approach to embedded systems, introducing the engineering concepts underlying embedded systems as a technology and as a subject of study. The focus is on modeling, design, and analysis of cyber-physical systems, which integrate computation, networking, and physical processes. The second edition offers two new chapters, several new exercises, and other improvements.

Imitation is of particular importance in enabling robotic or software agents to share skills without the intervention of a programmer and in the more general context of interaction and collaboration between software agents and humans. Imitation provides a way for the agent—whether biological or artificial—to establish a \"social relationship\" and learn about the demonstrator's actions, in order to include them in its own behavioral repertoire. Building robots and software agents that can imitate other artificial or human agents in an appropriate way involves complex problems of perception, experience, context, and action, solved in nature in various ways by animals that imitate.

The HRI Conference is a highly selective, single track, international meeting showcasing the best research in human-robot interaction, with roots in and broad participation from various communities of scholars, including but not limited to robotics, human-computer interaction, artificial intelligence, engineering, social and behavioral sciences, and design. The theme of this year's conference is \"Smart Interaction,\" following our host city Vienna's ongoing \"Smart City\" initiative. Designed with increasingly intelligent capabilities, robots must utilize such intelligence also in their interactions with people to improve the effectiveness, naturalness, and intuitiveness of these interactions as well as their moral and ethical consequences. Achieving intelligence in interaction requires the multidisciplinary convergence of technical, social, and design perspectives. To represent this multidisciplinarity, we solicited and reviewed papers under four submission themes: \"Human-Robot Interaction User Studies,\" \"Technical Advances in Human-Robot Interaction,\" \"Human-Robot Interaction Design,\" and \"Theory and Methods in Human-Robot Interaction.\" Each submission theme was overseen by a dedicated theme chair and reviewed by a dedicated group of program committee members, who worked together with the program chairs to define and apply review criteria appropriate to each of the four contribution types. The conference attracted 211 submissions from 38 unique countries from Asia-Pacific, Europe, the Middle East, and North America. Each full paper was aligned with a theme-appropriate subcommittee, and subsequently reviewed through a double-blind process, which was followed by a rebuttal phase, and shepherding where found appropriate by the program committee. As a result of the review process, the program committee selected 51 (24.2%) of the submissions for presentation as full papers at the conference. As the conference is jointly sponsored by IEEE and ACM, papers are archived in both the ACM Digital Library and the IEEE Xplore. Along with the full papers, the conference program and proceedings include the Late Breaking Reports, Videos, Demos, and an alt.HRI section. Out of 144 total submissions, 142 (98.6%) Late Breaking Reports (LBRs) were accepted and will be presented as posters at the conference. A new peer-review process ensured that authors of LBR submissions received detailed feedback on their work. Sixteen (80.0%) short videos were accepted for presentation during a dedicated video session from 20 submissions. The program also includes 12 demos of robot systems that participants will have an opportunity to interact with during the conference. We continue to include an alt.HRI session in this year's program, consisting of 4 papers (selected out of 19 submissions) that push the boundaries of thought and practice in the field. This year, we have reintroduced the Student Design Competition event to encourage student participation in the conference and enrich the program with novel ideas and insights developed by student teams. Finally, we have the pleasure of presenting three inspiring keynote speakers who will discuss topics relevant to HRI: Dr. Cynthia Breazeal from the MIT Media Lab and Jibo Inc. in the USA, Dr. Lucia Jacobs from the University of California, Berkeley in the USA, and Dr. Danica Kragic from the Royal Institute of Technology (KTH) in Sweden.

Firstly, a 6-DOF cable-driven force feedback apparatus based on parallel mechanism is designed and ultrasonic phased array is combined to form a multimodal haptic feedback system. Secondly, a multimodal haptic fusion method for cable-driven force and ultrasonic tactile is firstly proposed to invoke realistic compound haptic sensations. To enhance the rendering effects of each subsystem, admittance control is developed for a cable robot, and a new perceived magnitude model is established for ultrasound tactile rendering. A psychophysical experiment is conducted to study the perceived characteristics of multimodal haptic stimuli. To verify the proposed system, a series of experiments were carried out, whose results indicated that the system performs well at multi-property haptic rendering and confirm the accuracy and sensitive advantage of our system in virtual reality applications.

For real-time implementation, Raspberry Pi II was used, which can be placed on a robot to recognize emotions in interactive real-time applications. The proposed method includes face detection using Viola Jones Haar cascade, Active Shape Model (ASM) for feature extraction, and AdaBoost for classification in real- time. Performance of the proposed method was validated in real time by testing with subjects from different age groups expressing basic emotions with varying pose and illumination. 96% recognition accuracy at an average time of 120 ms was obtained. The results are encouraging, as the proposed method gives better accuracy with higher speed compared to existing methods from the literature.

Face to face communication is a real-time process operating at a a time scale in the order of 40 milliseconds. The level of uncertainty at this time scale is considerable, making it necessary for humans and machines to rely on sensory rich perceptual primitives rather than slow symbolic inference processes. In this paper we present progress on one such perceptual primitive. The system automatically detects frontal faces in the video stream and codes them with respect to 7 dimensions in real time: neutral, anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise. The face finder employs a cascade of feature detectors trained with boosting techniques [15, 2]. The expression recognizer receives image patches located by the face detector. A Gabor representation of the patch is formed and then processed by a bank of SVM classifiers. A novel combination of Adaboost and SVM's enhances performance. The system was tested on the Cohn-Kanade dataset of posed facial expressions [6]. The generalization performance to new subjects for a 7- way forced choice correct. Most interestingly the outputs of the classifier change smoothly as a function of time, providing a potentially valuable representation to code facial expression dynamics in a fully automatic and unobtrusive manner.

Artificial systems used to study imitation can both test models of imitation derived from observational or neurobiological data on imitation in animals and then apply them to different kinds of nonbiological systems ranging from robots to software agents. A crucial problem in imitation is the correspondence problem, mapping action sequences of the demonstrator and the imitator agent. This problem becomes particularly obvious when the two agents do not share the same embodiment and affordances.

Vision-based hand gesture recognition techniques have many proven advantages compared with traditional devices, giving users a simpler and more natural way to communicate with electronic devices. This work proposes a generic system architecture based in computer vision and machine learning, able to be used with any interface for human-computer interaction. The proposed solution is mainly composed of three modules: a pre-processing and hand segmentation module, a static gesture interface module and a dynamic gesture interface module. The experiments showed that the core of visionbased interaction systems could be the same for all applications and thus facilitate the implementation. For hand posture recognition, a SVM (Support Vector Machine) model was trained and used, able to achieve a final accuracy of 99.4%. For dynamic gestures, an HMM (Hidden Markov Model) model was trained for each gesture that the system could recognize with a final average accuracy of 93.7%.

Human-machine interaction technology has greatly evolved during the last decades, but manual and speech modalities remain single output channels with their typical constraints imposed by the motor system’s information transfer limits. Will brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) and gaze-based control be able to convey human commands or even intentions to machines in the near future? We provide an overview of basic approaches in this new area of applied cognitive research. Objective. We test the hypothesis that the use of communication paradigms and a combination of eye tracking with unobtrusive forms of registering brain activity can improve human-machine interaction. Methods and Results. Three groups of ongoing experiments at the Kurchatov Institute are reported. First, we discuss the communicative nature of human-robot interaction, and approaches to building a more e cient technology. Specifically, “communicative” patterns of interaction can be based on joint attention paradigms from developmental psychology, including a mutual “eye-to-eye” exchange of looks between human and robot. Further, we provide an example of “eye mouse” superiority over the computer mouse, here in emulating the task of selecting a moving robot from a swarm. Finally, we demonstrate a passive, noninvasive BCI that uses EEG correlates of expectation. This may become an important lter to separate intentional gaze dwells from non-intentional ones. Conclusion. The current noninvasive BCIs are not well suited for human-robot interaction, and their performance, when they are employed by healthy users, is critically dependent on the impact of the gaze on selection of spatial locations. The new approaches discussed show a high potential for creating alternative output pathways for the human brain.

An agent (a learning machine) is trained to perform a task from demonstrations by learning a mapping between observations and actions. The idea of teaching by imitation has been around for many years; however, the field is gaining attention recently due to advances in computing and sensing as well as rising demand for intelligent applications. The paradigm of learning by imitation is gaining popularity because it facilitates teaching complex tasks with minimal expert knowledge of the tasks. Generic imitation learning methods could potentially reduce the problem of teaching a task to that of providing demonstrations, without the need for explicit programming or designing reward functions specific to the task. Modern sensors are able to collect and transmit high volumes of data rapidly, and processors with high computational power allow fast processing that maps the sensory data to actions in a timely manner. This opens the door for many potential AI applications that require real-time perception and reaction such as humanoid robots, self-driving vehicles, human computer interaction, and computer games, to name a few. However, specialized algorithms are needed to effectively and robustly learn models as learning by imitation poses its own set of challenges. In this article, we survey imitation learning methods and present design options in different steps of the learning process. We introduce a background and motivation for the field as well as highlight challenges specific to the imitation problem. Methods for designing and evaluating imitation learning tasks are categorized and reviewed. Special attention is given to learning methods in robotics and games as these domains are the most popular in the literature and provide a wide array of problems and methodologies. We extensively discuss combining imitation learning approaches using different sources and methods, as well as incorporating other motion learning methods to enhance imitation. We also discuss the potential impact on industry, present major applications, and highlight current and future research directions.", "abstract_source": "openalex", "authors": ["Ahmed Hussein", "Mohamed Medhat Gaber", "Eyad Elyan", "Chrisina Jayne"], "publish_year": 2017, "venue": "", "citation_count": 912, "fields_of_study": ["Computer science", "Artificial intelligence", "Human–computer interaction", "Machine learning", "Biology", "Social psychology", "Pure mathematics", "Neuroscience", "Management", "Psychology", "Operating system", "Economics", "Mathematics"], "url": "https://openalex.org/W2604382266"}

We have created various computer-mediated virtual environments including social networks, video conferencing, virtual 3D worlds (e.g., VR Chat), augmented reality applications (e.g., Pokemon Go), and Non-Fungible Token Games (e.g., Upland). Such virtual environments, albeit non-perpetual and unconnected, have bought us various degrees of digital transformation. The term `metaverse' has been coined to further facilitate the digital transformation in every aspect of our physical lives. At the core of the metaverse stands the vision of an immersive Internet as a gigantic, unified, persistent, and shared realm. While the metaverse may seem futuristic, catalysed by emerging technologies such as Extended Reality, 5G, and Artificial Intelligence, the digital `big bang' of our cyberspace is not far away. This survey paper presents the first effort to offer a comprehensive framework that examines the latest metaverse development under the dimensions of state-of-the-art technologies and metaverse ecosystems, and illustrates the possibility of the digital `big bang'. First, technologies are the enablers that drive the transition from the current Internet to the metaverse. We thus examine eight enabling technologies rigorously - Extended Reality, User Interactivity (Human-Computer Interaction), Artificial Intelligence, Blockchain, Computer Vision, IoT and Robotics, Edge and Cloud computing, and Future Mobile Networks. In terms of applications, the metaverse ecosystem allows human users to live and play within a self-sustaining, persistent, and shared realm. Therefore, we discuss six user-centric factors -- Avatar, Content Creation, Virtual Economy, Social Acceptability, Security and Privacy, and Trust and Accountability. Finally, we propose a concrete research agenda for the development of the metaverse.", "abstract_source": "openalex", "authors": ["Lik‐Hang Lee", "Tristan Braud", "Pengyuan Zhou", "Lin Wang", "Dianlei Xu", "Zijun Lin", "Abhishek Kumar", "Carlos Bermejo", "Pan Hui"], "publish_year": 2021, "venue": "", "citation_count": 896, "fields_of_study": ["Computer science", "Human–computer interaction", "World Wide Web", "Political science", "Law"], "url": "https://openalex.org/W3206525235"}

Many applications, including video surveillance systems, human-computer interaction, and robotics for human behavior characterization, require a multiple activity recognition system. In this work, we provide a detailed review of recent and state-of-the-art research advances in the field of human activity classification. We propose a categorization of human activity methodologies and discuss their advantages and limitations. In particular, we divide human activity classification methods into two large categories according to whether they use data from different modalities or not. Then, each of these categories is further analyzed into sub-categories, which reflect how they model human activities and what type of activities they are interested in. Moreover, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the existing, publicly available human activity classification datasets and examine the requirements for an ideal human activity recognition dataset.

As a consequence of these trends, the nature of many of the devices and systems with which people interact, in the workplace and elsewhere, has been changing rapidly and is likely to continue to do so in the future. In particular, devices are acquiring more and more cognitive‐type capabilities and are being used to perform an increasingly large fraction of the tasks once done by human beings. On the other hand, the increasing versatility of machines can expand greatly the universe of things that people can do with their help. Human factors researchers and engineers are concerned with the question of how to design tools, appliances, vehicles, communication devices and other artifacts so they are well matched to the capabilities and limitations of human beings and contribute positively to the safety, comfort, and productivity of their users. This concern will be at least as important in the future as it has been in the past, but the context in which it is exercised will be different in many respects. Reflection on how information technology may continue to evolve and be used raises many human factors issues and questions that need to be addressed. @ 1995 John WIley &amp; Sons, Inc.", "abstract_source": "openalex", "authors": ["Raymond S.

This year it was held in Denver, bordering the beautiful Rocky Mountain region in the U.S., and reflected in our logo. The CHI 2017 conference began with two days of workshops and symposia, followed by four days of a technical program with 17 parallel sessions of provocative papers, panels, case studies, SIGs (Special Interest Groups), courses, and the popular student research, design, and game competitions. The growing alt.chi forum, now in its twelfth year, presented stimulating new ideas in HCI. The Interactivity forum showcased cutting-edge technology. For its second year, the CHI Art Exhibit merged art and technology in fascinating ways. This innovative work can be found in the Proceedings and Extended Abstracts, archived in the ACM Digital Library. For papers, the conference received 2400 submissions which were rigorously reviewed, resulting in 600 accepted papers. To ensure a better fit with reviewers, new subcommittees were created. Across all tracks, CHI received nearly 5000 submissions and accepted over 1000. Our conference theme this year, Explore, Innovate, Inspire, informed our planning process. A new venue held this year was CHI Stories. We generally know little of the personalities that drive the research presented at CHI. CHI Stories is a chance for CHI community members to share personal stories of inspiration, challenge, successes and failures, and grit. We also focused on inclusion this year. Hundreds of CHI attendees volunteered their skills in a Day of Service partnering with non-profit organizations. Inclusion was also manifest throughout the conference, for example, in the Diversity and Inclusion Lunch and by using telepresence robots to enable people with disabilities to participate remotely in the conference. Our keynote speakers were chosen to reflect our conference theme. The speakers were Neri Oxman, who combines computational design, digital fabrication, materials science and synthetic biology; Ben Shneiderman a founder of the CHI conference who, along with some key CHI personalities, gave a perspective on CHI's history and future; Wael Ghonim, credited with starting the Arab Spring and nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize; and best-selling author Nicholas Carr who challenges us to examine the unforeseen impacts of technology, particularly with automation. The world has experienced a dramatic change this past year. We live in extraordinary times and this calls for extraordinary thinking, something that the CHI community excels at. One of the challenges the community faced this year was responding to a U.S. executive order to ban citizens of certain countries from entering the country to attend CHI. As CHI is committed to inclusion, we decided to hold events at the conference to discuss and plan how we can continue our commitment to inclusion. The conference held a panel to discuss impacts of current political events on science, and hastily organized a panel to promote a conversation of civil liberties in science and a SIG on how the CHI community can participate in change. We are proud to have expanded telepresence options through the use of robots to enable people to participate in the conference remotely if they were physically unable to enter the country. We had a keynote speaker who inspired us on the topic of Internet activism.

Specifically, when users engage in socially-charged electronic environments to interact and communicate electronically with others, they find ways to overcome the relative lack of cues to adapt to the medium; this includes in terms of reacting to emotional relationships (Walther, 1997). We hypothesize that individuals who have a high sense of online community, engage with avatars and have higher levels of competence communicating with information and communication technologies (ICT), are more likely to recognize human like cues in robots. This in turn leads them to accept robots as part of their social and physical environments. A “robotic” social distance scale was developed to measure willingness to accept robots, and the results based on this scale, from an empirical study of college students (N = 874) are explored. The findings show that whereas avatar engagement and sense of online community have a strong effect on robots acceptance, recognition of human-like characteristics partially mediates the association between these concepts; this is even after accounting for predictors expected to affect attitudes toward robots such as religion, gender, age and robots’ appearance.

Despite this, robots have not yet reached a level of design that allows effective management of faulty or unexpected behavior by untrained users. To understand why this may be the case, an in-depth literature review was done to explore when people perceive and resolve robot failures, how robots communicate failure, how failures influence people's perceptions and feelings toward robots, and how these effects can be mitigated. Fifty-two studies were identified relating to communicating failures and their causes, the influence of failures on human-robot interaction (HRI), and mitigating failures. Since little research has been done on these topics within the HRI community, insights from the fields of human computer interaction (HCI), human factors engineering, cognitive engineering and experimental psychology are presented and discussed. Based on the literature, we developed a model of information processing for robotic failures (Robot Failure Human Information Processing, RF-HIP), that guides the discussion of our findings. The model describes the way people perceive, process, and act on failures in human robot interaction. The model includes three main parts: (1) communicating failures, (2) perception and comprehension of failures, and (3) solving failures. Each part contains several stages, all influenced by contextual considerations and mitigation strategies. Several gaps in the literature have become evident as a result of this evaluation. More focus has been given to technical failures than interaction failures. Few studies focused on human errors, on communicating failures, or the cognitive, psychological, and social determinants that impact the design of mitigation strategies. By providing the stages of human information processing, RF-HIP can be used as a tool to promote the development of user-centered failure-handling strategies for HRIs.", "abstract_source": "openalex", "authors": ["Shanee Honig", "Tal Oron-Gilad"], "publish_year": 2018, "venue": "", "citation_count": 286, "fields_of_study": ["Psychology", "Cognitive science", "Cognitive psychology", "Human–computer interaction", "Computer science"], "url": "https://openalex.org/W2808048733"}

The HRI Conference is a highly selective, single track, international meeting showcasing the best research in human-robot interaction, with roots in and broad participation from various communities of scholars, including but not limited to robotics, human-computer interaction, artificial intelligence, engineering, social and behavioral sciences, and design. The theme of this year's conference is \"Smart Interaction,\" following our host city Vienna's ongoing \"Smart City\" initiative. Designed with increasingly intelligent capabilities, robots must utilize such intelligence also in their interactions with people to improve the effectiveness, naturalness, and intuitiveness of these interactions as well as their moral and ethical consequences. Achieving intelligence in interaction requires the multidisciplinary convergence of technical, social, and design perspectives. To represent this multidisciplinarity, we solicited and reviewed papers under four submission themes: \"Human-Robot Interaction User Studies,\" \"Technical Advances in Human-Robot Interaction,\" \"Human-Robot Interaction Design,\" and \"Theory and Methods in Human-Robot Interaction.\" Each submission theme was overseen by a dedicated theme chair and reviewed by a dedicated group of program committee members, who worked together with the program chairs to define and apply review criteria appropriate to each of the four contribution types. The conference attracted 211 submissions from 38 unique countries from Asia-Pacific, Europe, the Middle East, and North America. Each full paper was aligned with a theme-appropriate subcommittee, and subsequently reviewed through a double-blind process, which was followed by a rebuttal phase, and shepherding where found appropriate by the program committee. As a result of the review process, the program committee selected 51 (24.2%) of the submissions for presentation as full papers at the conference. As the conference is jointly sponsored by IEEE and ACM, papers are archived in both the ACM Digital Library and the IEEE Xplore. Along with the full papers, the conference program and proceedings include the Late Breaking Reports, Videos, Demos, and an alt.HRI section. Out of 144 total submissions, 142 (98.6%) Late Breaking Reports (LBRs) were accepted and will be presented as posters at the conference. A new peer-review process ensured that authors of LBR submissions received detailed feedback on their work. Sixteen (80.0%) short videos were accepted for presentation during a dedicated video session from 20 submissions. The program also includes 12 demos of robot systems that participants will have an opportunity to interact with during the conference. We continue to include an alt.HRI session in this year's program, consisting of 4 papers (selected out of 19 submissions) that push the boundaries of thought and practice in the field. This year, we have reintroduced the Student Design Competition event to encourage student participation in the conference and enrich the program with novel ideas and insights developed by student teams. Finally, we have the pleasure of presenting three inspiring keynote speakers who will discuss topics relevant to HRI: Dr. Cynthia Breazeal from the MIT Media Lab and Jibo Inc. in the USA, Dr. Lucia Jacobs from the University of California, Berkeley in the USA, and Dr. Danica Kragic from the Royal Institute of Technology (KTH) in Sweden.

It further discusses important potential strategies, which can be useful to overcome these challenges based on a conceptual review of extant research. Design/methodology/approach The current paper undertakes a conceptual work where multiple streams of literature are integrated to present a rather holistic yet critical overview of the relationship between AI (particularly robots) and HRM in contemporary organisations. Findings We highlight that interaction and collaboration between human workers and robots is visible in a range of industries and organisational functions, where both are working as team members. This gives rise to unique challenges for HRM function in contemporary organisations where they need to address workers' fear of working with AI, especially in relation to future job loss and difficult dynamics associated with building trust between human workers and AI-enabled robots as team members. Along with these, human workers' task fulfilment expectations with their AI-enabled robot colleagues need to be carefully communicated and managed by HRM staff to maintain the collaborative spirit, as well as future performance evaluations of employees. The authors found that organisational support mechanisms such as facilitating environment, training opportunities and ensuring a viable technological competence level before organising human workers in teams with robots are important. Finally, we found that one of the toughest challenges for HRM relates to performance evaluation in teams where both humans and AI (including robots) work side by side. We referred to the lack of existing frameworks to guide HRM managers in this concern and stressed the possibility of taking insights from the computer gaming literature, where performance evaluation models have been developed to analyse humans and AI interactions while keeping the context and limitations of both in view. Originality/value Our paper is one of the few studies that go beyond a rather general or functional analysis of AI in the HRM context. It specifically focusses on the teamwork dimension, where human workers and AI-powered machines (robots) work together and offer insights and suggestions for such teams' smooth functioning.", "abstract_source": "openalex", "authors": ["Ahmad Arslan", "Cary L.

Traditional methods use electrically connected sensors with complex arrays, leading to intricate wiring, high manufacturing costs, and demanding current environments. A flexible sensor with simple structure, easy preparation process, and low cost based on triboluminescence effect is proposed in this paper, which avoids the complex array and wiring of traditional sensors. The study discusses the relationship between luminescent intensity and factors such as luminescent particle content, luminescent layer thickness, encapsulation layer thickness, and friction layer thickness. It also analyzes the mechanism of luminescence. A micro charge‐coupled device is configured for the luminescent unit to collect optical information and is integrated with the robot's manipulator for testing. A simple sensing system is constructed to demonstrate environmental perception, acquiring, and feeding back shape and size information of contact objects in the dark. The system successfully identifies and judges target objects in complex dark environments, offering insights for applications such as unmanned assembly lines.

In this article, we first introduce the concept of affordances as conceived by J. J. Gibson and review the use of the term in different fields, with particular emphasis on its use in autonomous robotics. Then, we summarize four of the major formalization proposals for the affordance term.

In this research, a framework to enable a person with an upper limb disability to use an assistive system toward maintaining self-reliance is introduced and its implementation and evaluation are discussed. The framework interlinks functional components and establishes a behavioral sequence to operate the assistive system in three stages; action classification, verification, and execution. An action is classified based on identified human intent and verified through haptic and/or visual feedback before execution. The human intent is conveyed through facial expressions and verified through head movements. The interlinked functional components are an electro-encephalogram (EEG) sensing device, a head movement recorder, a dual-purpose glove, a visual feedback environment, and a robotic arm. Five volunteers are used to evaluate the ability of the system to recognize a facial expression, the time required to respond using head movements, convey information through vibrotactile feedback effects, and the ability to follow the established behavioral sequence. Based on the evaluation, a personalized training dataset should be used to calibrate facial expression recognition and define the time required to respond during verification. Custom vibrotactile effects were effective in conveying system information to the user. The volunteers were able to follow the behavioral sequence and control the system with a success rate of 80.00%, thus providing confidence to recruit more volunteers to identify and address improvements and expand the operational capability of the framework.", "abstract_source": "openalex", "authors": ["Sudip Hazra", "Shane Whitaker", "Panos S.

Critical questions include how long implanted microelectrodes will record useful neural signals, how reliably those signals can be acquired and decoded, and how effectively they can be used to control various assistive technologies such as computers and robotic assistive devices, or to enable functional electrical stimulation of paralyzed muscles. Here we examined these questions by assessing neural cursor control and BrainGate system characteristics on five consecutive days 1000 days after implant of a 4 × 4 mm array of 100 microelectrodes in the motor cortex of a human with longstanding tetraplegia subsequent to a brainstem stroke. On each of five prospectively-selected days we performed time-amplitude sorting of neuronal spiking activity, trained a population-based Kalman velocity decoding filter combined with a linear discriminant click state classifier, and then assessed closed-loop point-and-click cursor control. The participant performed both an eight-target center-out task and a random target Fitts metric task which was adapted from a human-computer interaction ISO standard used to quantify performance of computer input devices.

Across the five days, spiking signals were obtained from 41 of 96 electrodes and were successfully decoded to provide neural cursor point-and-click control with a mean task performance of 91.3% ± 0.1% (mean ± s.d.) correct target acquisition.

It is desirable for a robot to carry out human following, as one of the human-affinitive movements. The human-following robot requires several techniques: the recognition of the target human, the recognition of the environment around the robot, and the control strategy for following a human stably. In this research, an intelligent environment is used in order to achieve these goals. An intelligent environment is a space in which many sensors and intelligent devices are distributed. Mobile robots exist in this space as physical agents providing humans with services. A mobile robot is controlled to follow a walking human using distributed intelligent sensors as stably and precisely as possible.

The industrial robot is a specific type of a handling machine, which can work similarly to a human, and can be used in different areas in a factory. Therefore, there is a need to consider all important human and robotic factors early in the manufacturing process and industrial system design. Especially the computer simulation of the production processes with the use of Discrete Event Simulation method, carried out for the needs of a new project, allows us to already include the process flow at the industry system planning stage, before real implementation. The purpose of this work is developing a framework of a digital twin of a manufacturing system. An example of a newly designed manufacturing system for the production of elements from the automotive industry is presented, as well as simulation models developed in the FlexSim program, which enables predefined parametrized objects for humans and robots. An area requiring improvement was defined, and the possible effects of these actions on the overall process were reengineered, considering the parameters of availability, performance, quality, and failure rate that make up the OFE (Overall Factory Effectiveness) metric. The information obtained during the simulation allowed us to define the location of the bottleneck in the process, and thus determine what to focus on during the implementation of the manufacturing line.

Such wearable robots will need soft sensors to monitor the movement of the wearer and robot outside the lab. Until now wearable soft sensors have not demonstrated significant mechanical robustness nor been systematically characterized for human motion studies of walking and running. Here, we present the design and systematic characterization of a soft sensing suit for monitoring hip, knee, and ankle sagittal plane joint angles. We used hyper-elastic strain sensors based on microchannels of liquid metal embedded within elastomer, but refined their design with the use of discretized stiffness gradients to improve mechanical durability. We found that these robust sensors could stretch up to 396% of their original lengths, would restrict the wearer by less than 0.17% of any given joint’s torque, had gauge factor sensitivities of greater than 2.2, and exhibited less than 2% change in electromechanical specifications through 1500 cycles of loading–unloading. We also evaluated the accuracy and variability of the soft sensing suit by comparing it with joint angle data obtained through optical motion capture. The sensing suit had root mean square (RMS) errors of less than 5° for a walking speed of 0.89 m/s and reached a maximum RMS error of 15° for a running speed of 2.7 m/s. Despite the deviation of absolute measure, the relative repeatability of the sensing suit’s joint angle measurements were statistically equivalent to that of optical motion capture at all speeds.

In a social HRI laboratory experiment, we investigated contextual incongruence (i.e., the conflict situation where a robot's reaction is incongrous with the socio-emotional context of the interaction) and cross-modal incongruence (i.e., the conflict situation where an observer receives incongruous emotional information across the auditory (vocal prosody) and visual (whole-body expressions) modalities). Results showed that both contextual incongruence and cross-modal incongruence confused observers and decreased the likelihood that they accurately recognized the emotional expressions of the robot. This, in turn, gives the impression that the robot is unintelligent or unable to express ``empathic'' behaviour and leads to profoundly harmful effects on likability and believability.

A common assumption is that social robots can and should mimic humans, such that human–robot interaction (HRI) closely resembles human-human (i.e., interpersonal) interaction. Research is often framed from the assumption that rules and theories that apply to interpersonal interaction should apply to HRI (e.g., the computers are social actors framework). Here, we challenge these assumptions and consider more deeply the relevance and applicability of our knowledge about personal relationships to relationships with social robots. First, we describe the typical characteristics of HSRs available to consumers currently, elaborating characteristics relevant to understanding social interactions with robots such as form anthropomorphism and behavioral anthropomorphism. We also consider common social affordances of modern HSRs (persistence, personalization, responsiveness, contingency, and conversational control) and how these align with human capacities and expectations. Next, we present predominant interpersonal theories whose primary claims are foundational to our understanding of human relationship development (social exchange theories, including resource theory, interdependence theory, equity theory, and social penetration theory). We consider whether interpersonal theories are viable frameworks for studying HRI and human–robot relationships given their theoretical assumptions and claims.

The modern field of AI began at a small summer workshop at Dartmouth College in 1956. Since then, AI applications made possible by machine learning (ML), an AI subdiscipline, include Internet searches, e‐commerce sites, goods and services recommender systems, image and speech recognition, sensor technologies, robotic devices, and cognitive decision support systems (DSSs). As more applications are integrated into everyday life, AI is predicted to have a globally transformative influence on economic and social structures similar to the effect that other general‐purpose technologies, such as steam engines, railroads, electricity, electronics, and the Internet, have had. Novel AI applications in the workplace of the future raise important issues for occupational safety and health. This commentary reviews the origins of AI, use of ML methods, and emerging AI applications embedded in physical objects like sensor technologies, robotic devices, or operationalized in intelligent DSSs. Selected implications on the future of work arising from the use of AI applications, including job displacement from automation and management of human‐machine interactions, are also reviewed.

The Conference is a highly selective, single track, international meeting showcasing the best research in human-robot interaction, with roots in and broad participation from various communities of scholars, including but not limited to robotics, human-computer interaction, artificial intelligence, engineering, social and behavioral sciences, and design.\r\n\r\nThe theme of this year's conference is Natural Interaction, an increasingly important research focus and design goal as robotic technologies become incorporated into everyday life. Achieving natural human-robot interaction requires the input of many technical, social, and design disciplines, as well as reflection on the societal consequences and ethical significance of robotic development. To represent the multitude of disciplines and approaches that contribute to this work and the field more generally in the conference program, we solicited and reviewed papers under four submission themes: Studies of HRI, Technical Advancements in HRI, HRI Design, and Theory and Method in HRI. Each submission theme was overseen by a dedicated theme chair and reviewed by a dedicated group of program committee members, who worked together with the program chairs to define and apply review criteria appropriate to each of the four contribution types.\r\n\r\nThe conference attracted 181 submissions from Asia-Pacific, Europe, the Middle East, and North America. Each full paper was aligned with a theme-appropriate subcommittee, and subsequently reviewed through a double-blind process, which was followed by a rebuttal phase, and shepherding where suggested by the program committee. As a result of the review process, the program committee selected 45 (24.8%) of the submissions for presentation as full papers at the conference. As the conference is jointly sponsored by IEEE and ACM, papers are archived in both IEEE Xplore and the ACM Digital Library.\r\n\r\nAlong with the full papers, the conference program and proceedings include the Late Breaking Reports, Videos, Demos, and a new alt.HRI section. Out of 95 total submissions, 71 (74.7%) Late Breaking Reports were accepted and will be presented as posters at the conference. Eleven (85%) short videos were accepted for presentation during a dedicated video session from 13 submissions. The program also includes four demos of robot systems that participants will have an opportunity to interact with during the conference. We're very excited to introduce an alt.HRI session in this year's program, consisting of five papers (selected out of 11 submissions) that push the boundaries of thought and practice in the field.

A trusted reference for almost 15 years, Fundamentals of Wearable Computers and Augmented Reality goes beyond smart clothing to explore user interface design issues specific to wearable tech and areas in which it can be applied. Upon its initial publication, the first edition almost instantly became a trusted reference, setting the stage for the coming decade, in which the explosion in research and applications of wearable computers and augmented reality occurred. Written by expert researchers and teachers, each chapter in the second edition has been revised and updated to reflect advances in the field and provide fundamental knowledge on each topic, solidifying the books reputation as a valuable technical resource as well as a textbook for augmented reality and ubiquitous computing courses.

Deciphered intents, after detecting electrical signals from the human scalp, are translated into control commands used to operate external devices, computer displays and virtual objects in the real-time. BCI provides an augmentative communication by creating a muscle-free channel between the brain and the output devices, primarily for subjects having neuromotor disorders, or trauma to nervous system, notably spinal cord injuries (SCI), and subjects with unaffected sensorimotor functions but disarticulated or amputated residual limbs. This review identifies the potentials of electroencephalography (EEG) based BCI applications for locomotion and mobility rehabilitation. Patients could benefit from its advancements such as wearable lower-limb (LL) exoskeletons, orthosis, prosthesis, wheelchairs, and assistive-robot devices. The EEG communication signals employed by the aforementioned applications that also provide feasibility for future development in the field are sensorimotor rhythms (SMR), event-related potentials (ERP) and visual evoked potentials (VEP). The review is an effort to progress the development of user's mental task related to LL for BCI reliability and confidence measures. As a novel contribution, the reviewed BCI control paradigms for wearable LL and assistive-robots are presented by a general control framework fitting in hierarchical layers. It reflects informatic interactions, between the user, the BCI operator, the shared controller, the robotic device and the environment. Each sub layer of the BCI operator is discussed in detail, highlighting the feature extraction, classification and execution methods employed by the various systems. All applications' key features and their interaction with the environment are reviewed for the EEG-based activity mode recognition, and presented in form of a table. It is suggested to structure EEG-BCI controlled LL assistive devices within the presented framework, for future generation of intent-based multifunctional controllers. Despite the development of controllers, for BCI-based wearable or assistive devices that can seamlessly integrate user intent, practical challenges associated with such systems exist and have been discerned, which can be constructive for future developments in the field.", "abstract_source": "openalex", "authors": ["Madiha Tariq", "Pavel M.

Children with autism have difficulties with social interaction and several studies indicate that they show preference toward interaction with objects, such as computers and robots, rather than with humans. In 1991, Carol Gray developed Social Stories, an intervention tool aimed to increase children’s social skills. Social stories are short scenarios written or tailored for autistic individuals to help them understand and behave appropriately in social situations. This study shows that, in specific situations, the social performance of autistic children improves when using the robot Probo, as a medium for social story telling, than when a human reader tells the stories. The robot tells Social Stories to teach ASD children how to react in situations like saying “hello”, saying “thank you” and “sharing toys”. The robot has the capability of expressing emotions and attention via its facial expressions and its gaze. The paper discusses the use of Probo as an added-value therapeutic tool for social story telling and presents the first experimental results.

For example, if a robot has a face, a human might interact with it similarly to how humans interact with other creatures with faces, Specifically, a human might talk to it, gesture to it, smile at it, and so on. If a human interacts with a computer or a machine that understands spoken commands, the human might converse with the machine, expecting it to have competence in spoken language. In our research on a multimodal interface to mobile robots, we have assumed a model of communication and interaction that, in a sense, mimics how people communicate. Our interface therefore incorporates both natural language understanding and gesture recognition as communication modes. We limited the interface to these two modes to simplify integrating them in the interface and to make our research more tractable. We believe that with an integrated system, the user is less concerned with how to communicate (which interactive mode to employ for a task), and is therefore free to concentrate on the tasks and goals at hand. Because we integrate all our system's components, users can choose any combination of our interface's modalities.

We explore what this requirement entails for artificial intelligence and automated decision-making systems. We address the topic of transparency in artificial intelligence by integrating legal, social, and ethical aspects. We first investigate the ratio legis of the transparency requirement in the General Data Protection Regulation and its ethical underpinnings, showing its focus on the provision of information and explanation. We then discuss the pitfalls with respect to this requirement by focusing on the significance of contextual and performative factors in the implementation of transparency. We show that human–computer interaction and human-robot interaction literature do not provide clear results with respect to the benefits of transparency for users of artificial intelligence technologies due to the impact of a wide range of contextual factors, including performative aspects. We conclude by integrating the information- and explanation-based approach to transparency with the critical contextual approach, proposing that transparency as required by the General Data Protection Regulation in itself may be insufficient to achieve the positive goals associated with transparency. Instead, we propose to understand transparency relationally, where information provision is conceptualized as communication between technology providers and users, and where assessments of trustworthiness based on contextual factors mediate the value of transparency communications. This relational concept of transparency points to future research directions for the study of transparency in artificial intelligence systems and should be taken into account in policymaking.", "abstract_source": "openalex", "authors": ["Heike Felzmann", "Eduard Fosch‐Villaronga", "Christoph Lutz", "Aurelia Tamò‐Larrieux"], "publish_year": 2019, "venue": "", "citation_count": 362, "fields_of_study": ["Computer science", "Knowledge management", "Data science", "Computer security", "Epistemology", "Philosophy"], "url": "https://openalex.org/W2954197146"}

We found that participants desired a combination of the interface design approaches. As a result, the UML system was changed to augment its heavy emphasis on video with a map view of the area immediately around the robot. The changes were tested in a follow-up user study and the results from that experiment suggest that performance, as measured by the number of collisions with objects in the environment and time on task, is better with the new interaction techniques. Throughout the paper, we describe how we applied human-computer interaction principles and techniques to benefit the evolution of the human-robot interaction designs.

Problems occur in complex scenes involving high speeds. Activity prediction using Artificial Intelligence (AI) by numerical analysis has attracted the attention of several researchers. Human activities are an important challenge in various fields. There are many great applications in this area, including smart homes, assistive robotics, human–computer interactions, and improvements in protection in several areas such as security, transport, education, and medicine through the control of falling or aiding in medication consumption for elderly people. The advanced enhancement and success of deep learning techniques in various computer vision applications encourage the use of these methods in video processing. The human presentation is an important challenge in the analysis of human behavior through activity. A person in a video sequence can be described by their motion, skeleton, and/or spatial characteristics.

The purpose of this paper is to review growing empirical support for efficacy of technology-based interventions with children with autism and to recommend future directions for research. This review will focus on five examples of technology introduced as a temporary instructional aid to be removed once goal of behavior change has been met: (a) tactile and auditory prompting devices, (b) video-based instruction and feedback, (c) computer-aided instruction, (d) virtual reality, and (e) robotics. Future directions for research and practice with each technology are discussed. Keywords: autism; technology-based interventions; computer-aided instruction; virtual reality; robotics. ********** A growing number of studies have investigated diverse applications of technology-based interventions with children with autism. The popularity of technology in field of psychology is evidenced by development of new journals in area (e.g., Journal of Special Education Technology, Journal of Educational Multimedia and Hypermedia, Journal of Computer Assisted Learning, etc.). In addition, clinical psychology journals are recognizing importance of technology in service delivery and devoting special issues to topic (e.g., Newman, 2004). Parents and clinicians regularly report that children with autism are drawn to technological devices and researchers have noted importance of devising treatments that take advantage of this fascination (Colby, 1973). The purpose of this paper is to review growing empirical support for efficacy of technology-based interventions with children with autism and to recommend future directions for research. A review of technology-based interventions must first clarify use of word technology. The term is broadly defined as the practical application of knowledge or the specialized aspects of a particular field of endeavor (Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary, 1994, p. 1210). This broad definition encompasses virtually any information or object that has been used in application to a field of study. For example, application of stimulus control is technology to a behavioral clinician. A more specific use of term refers to use of mechanical or electromechanical processes that often increase productivity and reduce or eliminate manual operations or operations done by older technologies. In twenty-first century, technology commonly denotes a variety of popular electromechanical devices such as cell phones, video recording equipment, and hand-held, desktop, and laptop personal computers. It is use of these tools with children with autism that will be subject of this review paper. Some technology-based interventions are designed for indefinite use as an assistive tool (e.g., voice-output augmentative communication devices, microswitches, etc.) while others are introduced as a temporary instructional aid to be removed once goal of behavior change has been met. This review will focus on five examples of second category: tactile and auditory prompting devices, video-based instruction and feedback, computer-aided instruction, virtual reality, and robotics. Research support for use of each technological advancement with children with autism will be reviewed, and directions for future research and practical application will be discussed. Mechanical Prompts Individuals with autism often need external stimulus prompts to initiate, maintain, or terminate a behavior. Commonly used prompts include vocal, gestural, physical, written/pictorial, and signed prompts, and each modality has been demonstrated effective for multiple purposes (MacDuff, Krantz, & McClannahan, 2001). Technological advancements in last decade have created cost-effective automated prompting devices with ability to deliver same level of prompting with less human interaction and obtrusiveness and often less human effort in managing prompt delivery (e. …", "abstract_source": "openalex", "authors": ["Tina R.

The HRI Conference is a highly selective international meeting showcasing the best research in human-robot interaction (HRI), with broad participation from various communities of scholars, including robotics, human-computer interaction, artificial intelligence, engineering, social and behavioral sciences, and design. The theme of this year's conference is \"Robots for Social Good,\" considering two trends that have shaped HRI-related technologies in the past year. One is that after many years of research, social robots are being finally introduced 'en masse' as consumer devices. And the second is a worldwide recognition, increasingly appreciated in the consumer software sector, that developers of new technologies need to be cognizant of the societal consequences of psychologically impactful devices. Balancing this societal and humanistic goal with the continuous evolution of technology, both in hardware and software, requires the multidisciplinary view that the HRI conference offers. To support this coming together of research areas, we solicited and reviewed papers under four submission themes: \"Human-Robot Interaction User Studies,\" \"Technical Advances in Human-Robot Interaction,\" \"Human-Robot Interaction Design,\" and \"Theory and Methods in Human-Robot Interaction.\" Each submission theme was overseen by a dedicated theme chair and reviewed by an expert group of program committee members, who worked together with the program chairs to define and apply review criteria appropriate to each of the four contribution types. The conference attracted 206 submissions from contributors worldwide, including countries from Asia-Pacific, Europe, the Middle East, and North America. Each full paper was aligned with a theme-appropriate subcommittee, and subsequently reviewed through a double-blind process, which was followed by a rebuttal phase, and shepherding where found appropriate by the program committee. Following the review process, the program committee selected 49 (23.8%) of the submissions for presentation as full papers at the conference. As the conference is jointly sponsored by IEEE and ACM, papers are archived in both the ACM Digital Library and the IEEE Xplore. This year, accommodating for the continued growth of the HRI conference, and with the goal of allowing for ample presentation, discussion, and informal meeting time, we have started to adopt a dual-track format for some of the full paper sessions. This also allowed us to plan for presenting papers from alternative tracks, such as alt HRI, and experiment with new presentation formats, under the principle of reevaluating our methods and processes, as appropriate for a conference covering a rapidly evolving field. Along with the full papers, the conference program and proceedings include Late Breaking Reports, Videos, Demos, and an alt.HRI section. Out of 137 total submissions, 123 (89.8%) Late Breaking Reports (LBRs) were accepted and will be presented as posters at the conference. A new peer-review process ensured that authors of LBR submissions received detailed feedback on their work. Fourteen short videos were accepted for presentation during a dedicated video session. The program also includes 9 demos of robot systems that participants will have an opportunity to interact with during the conference. We continue to include an alt.HRI session in this year's program, consisting of 5 papers (selected out of 14 submissions, 35.7%) that push the boundaries of thought and practice in the field.

An elegant approach to improve the accuracy of BCIs consists in a verification procedure directly based on the presence of error-related potentials (ErrP) in the electroencephalogram (EEG) recorded right after the occurrence of an error. Several studies show the presence of ErrP in typical choice reaction tasks. However, in the context of a BCI, the central question is: \"Are ErrP also elicited when the error is made by the interface during the recognition of the subject's intent?\"; We have thus explored whether ErrP also follow a feedback indicating incorrect responses of the simulated BCI interface. Five healthy volunteer subjects participated in a new human-robot interaction experiment, which seem to confirm the previously reported presence of a new kind of ErrP. However, in order to exploit these ErrP, we need to detect them in each single trial using a short window following the feedback associated to the response of the BCI. We have achieved an average recognition rate of correct and erroneous single trials of 83.5% and 79.2%, respectively, using a classifier built with data recorded up to three months earlier.", "abstract_source": "openalex", "authors": ["Pierre W.

In our digital age, human social interaction is often mediated. However, even though there is increasing evidence that mediated touch affords affective communication, current communication systems (such as videoconferencing) still do not support communication through the sense of touch. As a result, mediated communication does not provide the intense affective experience of co-located communication. The need for ICT mediated or generated touch as an intuitive way of social communication is even further emphasized by the growing interest in the use of touch-enabled agents and robots for healthcare, teaching, and telepresence applications. Here, we review the important role of social touch in our daily life and the available evidence that affective touch can be mediated reliably between humans and between humans and digital agents. We base our observations on evidence from psychology, computer science, sociology, and neuroscience with focus on the first two. Our review shows that mediated affective touch can modulate physiological responses, increase trust and affection, help to establish bonds between humans and avatars or robots, and initiate pro-social behavior. We argue that ICT mediated or generated social touch can (a) intensify the perceived social presence of remote communication partners and (b) enable computer systems to more effectively convey affective information. However, this research field on the crossroads of ICT and psychology is still embryonic and we identify several topics that can help to mature the field in the following areas: establishing an overarching theoretical framework, employing better research methodologies, developing basic social touch building blocks, and solving specific ICT challenges.", "abstract_source": "openalex", "authors": ["Jan B.

The proposed method first learns short-term spatiotemporal features of gestures through the 3-D convolutional neural network, and then learns long-term spatiotemporal features by convolutional LSTM networks based on the extracted short-term spatiotemporal features. In addition, fine-tuning among multimodal data is evaluated, and we find that it can be considered as an optional skill to prevent overfitting when no pre-trained models exist. The proposed method is verified on the ChaLearn LAP large-scale isolated gesture data set (IsoGD) and the Sheffield Kinect gesture (SKIG) data set.

Statistics predict that by 2035, half of the population in Germany is going to be older than fifty, every third person even over 60. These ageing societies face numerous challenges in performing simple tasks in Activities of Daily Living “ADLs”. Increasingly, a lot of research is being focused on Ambient Assisted Living “AAL” which presents a new approach that promises to address the needs of elderly people. An important goal of AAL is to contribute to the quality of life of the elderly and handicapped people and help them to maintain an independent lifestyle. The introduction of robotics and technology-supported environments will play a huge role in allowing elderly and physically impaired people to keep living a self-determined, independent life in their familiar surroundings. In this paper, the implementation of a novel intuitive and adaptive manipulation scheme is proposed, by developing a human-machine communication interface between the Leap Motion controller and the 6-DOF Jaco robotic arm. An algorithm is developed to allow an optimum mapping between the user hand movement, tracked by the Leap Motion controller, and the Jaco arm. The system should allow for a more natural human-computer interaction and a smooth manipulation of the robotic arm, by constantly adapting to the user hand tremor or shake. The implementation would specially enhance the quality of living, especially for people with upper limb problems, and would support them in performing some of the essential Activities of Daily Living “ADLs”.

This is innovative and patented and the BOA dial integrated in the glove is attached to five elastic bands, one for each finger, which are secured in place by a channel placed on the TPU piece. This makes it lighter in weight. d) Intelligent. By being equipped with sensors, it can be intelligently sensed internally to properly release tension with promoting blood circulation in the wearer's hand, they push the BOA dial in and rotate it to increase tension, and to release tension, the user simply pulls the BOA dial upward. This will help the muscles relax and restore normal fluid movement. The data can be viewed in the accompanying app. After researching and investigating the existing human-machine interaction based robotic hand mostly made of steel, the sensor cannot sense the material of the object well after wearing, temperature, and the set finger bending angle cannot fit the object well.

Cobots interact with people by producing software‐defined “virtual surfaces” which constrain and guide the motion of the shared payload, but add little or no power. Ergonomic as well as productivity benefits result from combining the strength and computer‐interface of the cobot with the sensing and dexterity of the human worker.

These robots have the potential to be robust and versatile, even safer for human interaction compared to traditional rigid robots. Soft robots based on biomimetic principles are being designed for real life applications by paying attention to different shape, geometry, and actuation systems in these organisms that respond to surrounding environments and stimuli. Especially, caterpillars or inchworms have garnered attention due to their soft compliant structure and crawling locomotion system making them ideal for maneuvering in congested spaces as a transport function. Currently, there are two major challenges with design and fabrication of such soft robots: using an efficient actuation system and developing a simple manufacturing process. Different actuation systems have been explored, which include shape memory alloy based coils and hydraulic and pneumatic actuators. However, the intrinsic limitations due to overall size and control system of these actuators prevent their integration in flexibility, lightweight, and compact manner, limiting practical and untethered applications. In comparison, magnetic actuation demonstrates simple wireless noncontact control. In terms of manufacturing process, additive manufacturing has emerged as an effective tool for obtaining structural complexity with high resolution, accuracy, and desired geometry. This study proposes a fully three-dimensional (3D) printed, monolithic, and tetherless inchworm-inspired soft robot that uses magnetic actuation for linear locomotion and crawling. Its structure is multimaterial heterogeneous particle-polymer composite with locally programmed material compositions. This soft robot is directly printed in one piece from a 3D computer model, without any manual assembly or complex processing steps, and it can be controlled by an external wireless force. This article presents its design and manufacturing with the novel magnetic field assisted projection stereolithography technique. Analytical models and numerical simulations of the crawling locomotion of the soft robot are also presented and compared with the experimental results of the 3D printed prototype.

The main goal of this research is to face the problems that affect current robotic hands by introducing suitable design solutions aimed at achieving simplification and cost reduction while possibly enhancing robustness and performance. While certain aspects of the DEXMART Hand development have been presented in previous papers, this paper is the first to give a comprehensive description of the final hand version and its use to replicate human-like grasping. In this paper, particular emphasis is placed on the kinematics of the fingers and of the thumb, the wrist architecture, the dimensioning of the actuation system, and the final implementation of the position, force and tactile sensors. The paper focuses also on how these solutions have been integrated into the mechanical structure of this innovative robotic hand to enable precise force and displacement control of the whole system. Another important aspect is the lack of suitable control tools that severely limits the development of robotic hand applications. To address this issue, a new method for the observation of human hand behavior during interaction with common day-to-day objects by means of a 3D computer vision system is presented in this work together with a strategy for mapping human hand postures to the robotic hand. A simple control strategy based on postural synergies has been used to reduce the complexity of the grasp planning problem.

In this paper we exploit a unique feature of the ``brain channel'', namely that it carries information about cognitive states that are crucial for a purposeful interaction. One of these states is the awareness of erroneous responses. Different physiological studies have shown the presence of error-related potentials (ErrP) in the EEG recorded right after people get aware they have made an error. However, for human-computer interaction, the central question is whether ErrP are also elicited when the error is made by the interface during the recognition of the subject's intent and no longer by errors of the subject himself. In this paper we report experimental results with three volunteer subjects during a simple human-robot interaction (i.e., bringing the robot to either the left or right side of a room) that seem to reveal a new kind of ErrP, which is satisfactorily recognized in single trials.

The HRI Conference is highly selective and aims to showcase the very best interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary research in human-robot interaction with roots in robotics, social psychology, cognitive science, human-computer interaction, human factors, artificial intelligence, design, engineering, and etc. Robotics has become increasingly multidisciplinary in order to realize realizing capable and collaborative robot systems that are used and validated in both laboratory and real-world settings. We therefore invite broad participation and encourage discussion and sharing of ideas across a diverse audience. This year's overall conference theme, titled \"Broadening HRI: Enabling Technologies, Designs, Methods, and Knowledge,\" highlights the different types of contributions made by our multidisciplinary community centered around developing robotic systems that operate, collaborate with, learn from, and meet the needs of the human users. Acknowledgment and encouragement of this diversity was supported in the peer-review process by establishing five subcommittees, \"Studies of HRI,\" \"Enabling Technologies, \"Enabling Designs,\" \"Enabling Methods,\" and \"Enabling Knowledge,\" each with a chair and dedicated program committee members. Together with the subcommittee chairs, we established and applied different set of review criteria for each of the five contribution types in order to represent the diversity of contributions in the conference program. HRI is a highly selective conference, and this year was no exception. The conference attracted 169 submissions from Asia-Pacific, Europe, the Middle East, and North America. Full Papers were aligned with a subcommittee, who managed the thorough review and discussion of the papers following a double-blind process. The process utilized a rebuttal phase, a shepherding mechanism, and a worldwide team of interdisciplinary reviewers. At the end of the process, the program committee selected 43 (25%) of the submissions. Due to the joint sponsorship of ACM and IEEE, papers are archived in both the ACM Digital Library and IEEE Xplore. Accompanying the full papers are the Late Breaking Reports, Videos, and Demos. Out of 102 submissions, 92 (90%) Late Breaking Reports were accepted and are presented at the conference poster sessions. Sixteen (84%) short videos were accepted for presentation during a dedicated video session from among 19 submissions. The program also includes nine demos of robot systems for all participants to interact with during the conference. The invited panel session, titled \"Human-Robot Interaction: Law on the home front\" will discuss contemporary and emerging issues in HRI.

However, handcrafted representation-based approaches are still widely used due to some bottlenecks such as computational complexity of deep learning techniques for activity recognition. However, approaches based on handcrafted representation are not able to handle complex scenarios due to their limitations and incapability; therefore, resorting to deep learning-based techniques is a natural option. This review paper presents a comprehensive survey of both handcrafted and learning-based action representations, offering comparison, analysis, and discussions on these approaches. In addition to this, the well-known public datasets available for experimentations and important applications of HAR are also presented to provide further insight into the field.

In this paper, we instrument a robot with such a prediction ability by leveraging recent deep learning and computer vision techniques. First, our system takes images from the robot camera as input to produce the corresponding human skeleton based on real-time human pose estimation obtained with the OpenPose library. Then, conditioning on this historical sequence, the robot forecasts plausible motion through a motion predictor, generating a corresponding demonstration. Because of a lack of high-level fidelity validation, existing forecasting algorithms suffer from error accumulation and inaccurate prediction.

The binocular vision system indicates what the robot is looking at and is not used for locomotion. Gaze control plays an important role in human-robot interaction. This paper reports how the robot's gaze influences subjects' impressions of the robot. With a statistically significant number of robot observers, we employed psychological methods, the semantic differential method (SD), and factor analysis. This careful psychological analysis of robot impressions is the first trial in robotics. Through the experiment, we have found that the impressions mainly consist of four factors: familiarity, enjoyment, activity, and performance.

An fMRI study of alleged competition with an artificial intelligence", "abstract": "Mentalizing is defined as the inference of mental states of fellow humans, and is a particularly important skill for social interactions. Here we assessed whether activity in brain areas involved in mentalizing is specific to the processing of mental states or can be generalized to the inference of non-mental states by comparing brain responses during the interaction with an intentional and an artificial agent. Participants were scanned using fMRI during interactive rock-paper-scissors games while believing their opponent was a fellow human (Intentional agent, Int), a humanoid robot endowed with an artificial intelligence (Artificial agent, Art), or a computer playing randomly (Random agent, Rnd). Participants' subjective reports indicated that they adopted different stances against the three agents. The contrast of brain activity during interaction with the artificial and the random agents didn't yield any cluster at the threshold used, suggesting the absence of a reproducible stance when interacting with an artificial intelligence. We probed response to the artificial agent in regions of interest corresponding to clusters found in the contrast between the intentional and the random agents. In the precuneus involved in working memory, the posterior intraparietal suclus, in the control of attention and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, in executive functions, brain activity for Art was larger than for Rnd but lower than for Int, supporting the intrinsically engaging nature of social interactions. A similar pattern in the left premotor cortex and anterior intraparietal sulcus involved in motor resonance suggested that participants simulated human, and to a lesser extend humanoid robot actions, when playing the game. Finally, mentalizing regions, the medial prefrontal cortex and right temporoparietal junction, responded to the human only, supporting the specificity of mentalizing areas for interactions with intentional agents.", "abstract_source": "openalex", "authors": ["Thierry Chaminade", "Delphine Rosset", "D.

In this work, we propose a new network intrusion detection method that is appropriate for an Internet of Things network. The proposed method is based on a conditional variational autoencoder with a specific architecture that integrates the intrusion labels inside the decoder layers. The proposed method is less complex than other unsupervised methods based on a variational autoencoder and it provides better classification results than other familiar classifiers. More important, the method can perform feature reconstruction, that is, it is able to recover missing features from incomplete training datasets. We demonstrate that the reconstruction accuracy is very high, even for categorical features with a high number of distinct values.

The recent advances on User-Centered Design (UCD) applied to Natural User Interfaces (NUIs) intend to make use of human innate features, such as speech, gestures and vision to interact with technology in the way humans would with one another. In this paper, a Graphical User Interface (GUI) and several NUI methods are studied and implemented, along with computer vision techniques, in a single software framework for aerial robotics called Aerostack which allows for intuitive and natural human-quadrotor interaction in indoor GPS-denied environments. These strategies include speech, body position, hand gesture and visual marker interactions used to directly command tasks to the drone. The NUIs presented are based on devices like the Leap Motion Controller, microphones and small size monocular on-board cameras which are unnoticeable to the user. Thanks to this UCD perspective, the users can choose the most intuitive and effective type of interaction for their application.

This system is intended to be used during human–robot interaction, and it is integrated as part of the overall interaction system of the robot: the Robotics Dialog System (RDS). Two modes are used to detect emotions: the voice and face expression analysis. In order to analyze the voice of the user, a new component has been developed: Gender and Emotion Voice Analysis (GEVA), which is written using the Chuck language. For emotion detection in facial expressions, the system, Gender and Emotion Facial Analysis (GEFA), has been also developed. This last system integrates two third-party solutions: Sophisticated High-speed Object Recognition Engine (SHORE) and Computer Expression Recognition Toolbox (CERT). Once these new components (GEVA and GEFA) give their results, a decision rule is applied in order to combine the information given by both of them. The result of this rule, the detected emotion, is integrated into the dialog system through communicative acts. Hence, each communicative act gives, among other things, the detected emotion of the user to the RDS so it can adapt its strategy in order to get a greater satisfaction degree during the human–robot dialog. Each of the new components, GEVA and GEFA, can also be used individually. Moreover, they are integrated with the robotic control platform ROS (Robot Operating System). Several experiments with real users were performed to determine the accuracy of each component and to set the final decision rule.

Architects have been exploring the use of digital technologies for the design and assembly of structures for some time now, and many facilities for investigating nonstandard architectural design and fabrication using industrial robots have sprung up in the past decade [2]-[4]. However, robot arms and computer numerical control (CNC) machines are limited by predefined working areas that constrain the size of the workpiece they can act upon and are thus also limited in their scale of action to a small portion or component of the overall structure, or to model-sized fabrication [5]. In contrast, flying machines are not constrained by such tight boundaries. The space that flying machines can act upon is substantially larger than the size of the machines themselves, making it feasible for the machines to work on the structure as a whole at a 1:1 scale, thus offering architects a new framework for realizing their designs.", "abstract_source": "openalex", "authors": ["Frederico Augugliaro", "Sergei Lupashin", "Michael Hamer", "Cason Male", "Markus Hehn", "Mark W.

To address this problem, we have previously proposed an adaptive hierarchical approach to brain-computer interfacing: users teach the BCI system new skills on-the-fly and these skills are later invoked directly as high-level commands, relieving the user of tedious lower-level control. However, the high-level commands learned from user demonstrations are often not reliable due to incomplete or insuf-ficient data. In this paper, we address the unreliability of such learned high-level commands by proposing an interactive hierarchical BCI. The proposed approach utilizes an uncertainty metric in the learning algorithm to determine whether the learned high-level command is reliable enough to be performed in the present context. The BCI system interacts with the user to make the best decision at each stage. We illustrate the approach using an interactive hierarchical BCI for controlling a simulated wheeled robot. In a study involving two human subjects controlling the robot in a simulated home environment, each subject successfully used the system to complete a sequence of five different navigational tasks. Our results sug-gest that interactive hierarchical BCIs can provide a scalable and robust way of controlling complex robotic devices in real-world environments. 1", "abstract_source": "openalex", "authors": ["Mike Chung", "Willy Cheung", "Reinhold Scherer", "Rajesh P.

We believe that in order to adequately address those issues and engage in a productive normative discussion it is necessary to examine key concepts and categories. One such category is anthropomorphism. It is a well-known fact that AI's functionalities and innovations are often anthropomorphized (i.e., described and conceived as characterized by human traits). The general public's anthropomorphic attitudes and some of their ethical consequences (particularly in the context of social robots and their interaction with humans) have been widely discussed in the literature. However, how anthropomorphism permeates AI research itself (i.e., in the very language of computer scientists, designers, and programmers), and what the epistemological and ethical consequences of this might be have received less attention. In this paper we explore this issue. We first set the methodological/theoretical stage, making a distinction between a normative and a conceptual approach to the issues. Next, after a brief analysis of anthropomorphism and its manifestations in the public, we explore its presence within AI research with a particular focus on brain-inspired AI. Finally, on the basis of our analysis, we identify some potential epistemological and ethical consequences of the use of anthropomorphic language and discourse within the AI research community, thus reinforcing the need of complementing the practical with a conceptual analysis.", "abstract_source": "openalex", "authors": ["Arleen Salles", "Kathinka Evers", "Michele Farisco"], "publish_year": 2020, "venue": "", "citation_count": 235, "fields_of_study": ["Psychology", "Psychoanalysis"], "url": "https://openalex.org/W3013207429"}

Current state-of-the-art formulates this problem as a sequence-to-sequence task, in which a historical of 3D skeletons feeds a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) that predicts future movements, typically in the order of 1 to 2 seconds. However, one aspect that has been obviated so far, is the fact that human motion is inherently driven by interactions with objects and/or other humans in the environment. In this paper, we explore this scenario using a novel context-aware motion prediction architecture. We use a semantic-graph model where the nodes parameterize the human and objects in the scene and the edges their mutual interactions. These interactions are iteratively learned through a graph attention layer, fed with the past observations, which now include both object and human body motions. Once this semantic graph is learned, we inject it to a standard RNN to predict future movements of the human/s and object/s.

Many previous works on facial expression recognition focus on the well-known six universal facial expressions (happy, sad, fear, angry, surprise and disgust) under usage of unified (or non-separated) classification approach. However, for ordinary people, it is a very difficult task to make such facial expressions without much effort and training. Instead of universal facial expressions, many people show 'personalized' or 'individualized' facial expressions typically. Thus, for dealing with such personalities, we propose a method to construct a personalized classifier based on novel feature selection method. Specifically, feature selection is done by histogram-based approach in the frame of fuzzy neural networks(FNN). Besides, we also use an integrated approach for facial expression recognition. Actual experiments/simulations show that the proposed method is effective not only in view of facial expression recognition but also in view of pattern classifier itself.", "abstract_source": "openalex", "authors": ["Dae Jin Kim", "Zeungnam Bien", "Kwang‐Hyun Park"], "publish_year": 2004, "venue": "", "citation_count": 26, "fields_of_study": ["Computer science", "Artificial intelligence", "Machine learning", "Speech recognition", "Computer vision", "Psychiatry", "Psychology", "Social psychology"], "url": "https://openalex.org/W2139844606"}

This is applied also to production logistics settings with a multitude of transport tasks, e.g., between warehousing or material supply stations and production locations within larger production sites as for example in the automotive industry. In most cases, mixed environments where automated systems and humans collaborate (e.g., cobots) are not in the center of analysis and development endeavors although the worker's adoption and acceptance of new technologies are of crucial relevance. From an interdisciplinary research perspective, this constitutes an important research gap, as the future challenges for successful automated systems will rely mainly on human-computer interaction (HCI) in connection with an efficient collaboration between motivated workers, automated robotics, and transportation systems. We develop a HCI efficiency description in production logistics based on an interdisciplinary analysis consisting of three interdependent parts: (i) a production logistics literature review and process study, (ii) a computer science literature review and simulation study for an existing autonomous traffic control algorithm applicable to production logistics settings with the specific inclusion of human actors, and (iii) a work science analysis for automation settings referring to theoretical foundations and empirical findings regarding the management of workers in digital work settings.

A robot is an excellent tool to be used in therapy and teaching. It can transform teaching methods, not just in the classrooms but also in the in-house clinical practices. With the rapid advancement in deep learning techniques, robots became more capable of handling human behaviour. In this paper, we present a cost-efficient, socially designed robot called ‘Tinku’, developed to assist in teaching special needs children. ‘Tinku’ is low cost but is full of features and has the ability to produce human-like expressions. Its design is inspired by the widely accepted animated character ‘WALL-E’. Its capabilities include offline speech processing and computer vision—we used light object detection models, such as Yolo v3-tiny and single shot detector (SSD)—for obstacle avoidance, non-verbal communication, expressing emotions in an anthropomorphic way, etc. It uses an onboard deep learning technique to localize the objects in the scene and uses the information for semantic perception. We have developed several lessons for training using these features. A sample lesson about brushing is discussed to show the robot’s capabilities. Tinku is cute, and loaded with lots of features, and the management of all the processes is mind-blowing. It is developed in the supervision of clinical experts and its condition for application is taken care of. A small survey on the appearance is also discussed. More importantly, it is tested on small children for the acceptance of the technology and compatibility in terms of voice interaction. It helps autistic kids using state-of-the-art deep learning models. Autism Spectral disorders are being increasingly identified today’s world.

Fluent human-robot coexistence in manufacturing requires accurate estimation of the human motion intention so that the efficiency and safety of HRC can be guaranteed. Human motion is mainly defined as the sequential positions of the joints of human skeletons among traditional motion prediction solutions, which lead to a deficiency of tools or product components holding in hand. Context awareness based temporal processing is the key to evaluating human motion before the accomplishment of it, so as to save time as well as recognize the intention of the human. In this paper, a deep learning system combing convolutional neural network (CNN) and long short-term memory network (LSTM) towards vision signals is explored to predict human motion accurately. Creatively, this paper utilizes LSTM to extract temporal patterns of human motion automatically outputting the prediction result before motion takes place.

Human-human interaction and human-computer interaction research findings are relevant, but often limited because robots are different from both humans and computers. Therefore, new human-robot interaction (HRI) research methods can inform the design of robots suitable for inexperienced users. A video-based HRI (VHRI) methodology was here used to carry out a multi-national HRI user study for the prototype domestic robot BIRON (BIelefeld RObot companioN). Previously, the VHRI methodology was used in constrained HRI situations, while in this study HRIs involved a series of events as part of a 'home-tour' scenario. Thus, the present work is the first study of this methodology in extended HRI contexts with a multi-national approach. Participants watched videos of the robot interacting with a human actor and rated two robot behaviors (Extrovert and Introvert). Participants' perceptions and ratings of the robot's behaviors differed with regard to both verbal interactions and person following by the robot. The study also confirms that the VHRI methodology provides a valuable means to obtain early user feedback, even before fully working prototypes are available. This can usefully guide the future design work on robots, and associated verbal and non-verbal behaviors.

In this work we: 1) outline and inspire the possibility for integrating organic and regenerative living systems in HCI; 2) explore and characterize human-microbe interactions across contexts and scales; 3) provide principles for stimulating discussions, presentations, and brainstorms of microbial interfaces. We aim to make Living Bits accessible to researchers across HCI, synthetic biology, biotechnology, and interaction design to explore the next generation of biological HCI.", "abstract_source": "openalex", "authors": ["Pat Pataranutaporn", "Angela Vujic", "David S.

These disabilities can impact people's ability to independently conduct activities of daily living, including ambulating, eating, dressing, taking care of personal hygiene, and more. Mobile and manipulator robots, which can move about human environments and physically interact with objects and people, have the potential to assist people with disabilities in activities of daily living. Although the vision of physically assistive robots has motivated research across subfields of robotics for decades, such robots have only recently become feasible in terms of capabilities, safety, and price. More and more research involves end-to-end robotic systems that interact with people with disabilities in real-world settings. In this article, we survey papers about physically assistive robots intended for people with disabilities from top conferences and journals in robotics, human–computer interactions, and accessible technology, to identify the general trends and research methodologies. We then dive into three specific research themes—interaction interfaces, levels of autonomy, and adaptation—and present frameworks for how these themes manifest across physically assistive robot research.

Here, we report an ionic hydrogel (PTSM) prepared from polypropylene amine (PAM), tannic acid (TA), sodium alginate (SA), and MXene. Based on the multiple weak H-bonds, this hydrogel exhibits excellent stretchability (strain >4600%), adhesion, and self-healing. The introduction of MXene nanosheets endows the hydrogel sensor with a high gauge factor (GF) of 6.6. Meanwhile, it also enables triboelectric nanogenerators (PTSM-TENGs) fabricated from silicone rubber-encapsulated hydrogels to have excellent energy harvesting efficiency, with an instantaneous output power density of 54.24 mW/m<sup>2</sup>. We build a glove-based human-computer interaction (HMI) system using PTSM-TENGs. The multidimensional signal features of PTSM-TENG are extracted and analyzed by the HMI system, and the functions of gesture visualization and robot hand control are realized. In addition, triboelectric signals can be used for object recognition with the help of machine learning techniques. The glove based on PTSM-TENG achieves the classification and recognition of five objects through contact, with an accuracy rate of 98.7%.

For this reason designing of aesthetically appealing and socially attractive robots becomes necessary for realistic human-robot interactions. In this paper HEFES (Hybrid Engine for Facial Expressions Synthesis), an engine for generating and controlling facial expressions both on physical androids and 3D avatars is described. HEFES is part of a software library that controls a human robot called FACE (Facial Automaton for Conveying Emotions). HEFES was designed to allow users to create facial expressions without requiring artistic or animatronics skills and it is able to animate both FACE and its 3D replica.

In this study, a novel interaction has been introduced, wherein a social robot facilitated a small collaborative group activity of students in higher education. Thirty-six students completed a 3 h activity that covered the main content of a course in Human Computer Interaction. In this within-subject study, the students worked in groups of four on three activities, moving between three conditions: instructor facilitation of several groups using pen and paper for the activity; tablets facilitation, also used for the activity; and robot facilitation, using tablets for the activity. The robot facilitated the activity by introducing the different tasks, ensuring proper time management, and encouraging discussion among the students. This study examined the effects of facilitation type on attitudes toward the activity facilitation, the group activity, and the robot, using quantitative, and qualitative measures. Overall students perceived the robot positively, as friendly and responsive, even though the robot did not directly respond to the students' verbal communications. While most survey items did not convey significant differences between the robot, tablet, or instructor, we found significant correlations between perceptions of the robot, and attitudes toward the activity facilitation, and the group activity. Qualitative data revealed the drawbacks and benefits of the robot, as well as its relative perceived advantages over a human facilitator, such as better time management, objectivity, and efficiency. These results suggest that the robot's complementary characteristics enable a higher quality learning environment, that corresponds with students' requirements and that a Robot Supportive Collaborative Learning (RSCL) is a promising novel paradigm for higher education.", "abstract_source": "openalex", "authors": ["Rinat B.

In particular, with the rapid development of deep learning, artificial intelligence, and other computer technologies, gesture recognition and speech recognition have achieved breakthrough research progress. The search platform used in this work is mainly the Google Academic and literature database Web of Science. According to the keywords related to HCI and deep learning, such as “intelligent HCI”, “speech recognition”, “gesture recognition”, and “natural language processing”, nearly 1000 studies were selected. Then, nearly 500 studies of research methods were selected and 100 studies were finally selected as the research content of this work after five years (2019–2022) of year screening. First, the current situation of the HCI intelligent system is analyzed, the realization of gesture interaction and voice interaction in HCI is summarized, and the advantages brought by deep learning are selected for research. Then, the core concepts of gesture interaction are introduced and the progress of gesture recognition and speech recognition interaction is analyzed. Furthermore, the representative applications of gesture recognition and speech recognition interaction are described. Finally, the current HCI in the direction of natural language processing is investigated. The results show that the combination of intelligent HCI and deep learning is deeply applied in gesture recognition, speech recognition, emotion recognition, and intelligent robot direction. A wide variety of recognition methods were proposed in related research fields and verified by experiments. Compared with interactive methods without deep learning, high recognition accuracy was achieved. In Human–Machine Interfaces (HMIs) with voice support, context plays an important role in improving user interfaces. Whether it is voice search, mobile communication, or children’s speech recognition, HCI combined with deep learning can maintain better robustness. The combination of convolutional neural networks and long short-term memory networks can greatly improve the accuracy and precision of action recognition.

In robotics and related research fields, the study of understanding is often referred to as semantics, which dictates what does the world \"mean\" to a robot, and is strongly tied to the question of how to represent that meaning. With humans and robots increasingly operating in the same world, the prospects of human-robot interaction also bring semantics and ontology of natural language into the picture. Driven by need, as well as by enablers like increasing availability of training data and computational resources, semantics is a rapidly growing research area in robotics. The field has received significant attention in the research literature to date, but most reviews and surveys have focused on particular aspects of the topic: the technical research issues regarding its use in specific robotic topics like mapping or segmentation, or its relevance to one particular application domain like autonomous driving. A new treatment is therefore required, and is also timely because so much relevant research has occurred since many of the key surveys were published. This survey therefore provides an overarching snapshot of where semantics in robotics stands today. We establish a taxonomy for semantics research in or relevant to robotics, split into four broad categories of activity, in which semantics are extracted, used, or both. Within these broad categories we survey dozens of major topics including fundamentals from the computer vision field and key robotics research areas utilizing semantics, including mapping, navigation and interaction with the world.

Here, an all‐in‐one wearable system consisting of solar cell, cathode‐free zinc ion micro‐battery (ZIMB) and piezoresistive pressure sensor is proposed, achieving an ultralong and stable power supply. Under the action of photocurrent, this integrated system is stimulated to in situ generate MnO 2 on the initial cathode‐free substrate, meanwhile converts into chemical energy for powering the sensor, which eliminates prepreparation and treatment of the cathode for energy storage units. The facial cathode‐free ZIMB combining the all‐in‐one design enhances matching degree between different units and improves the integration. The working mechanism of the cathode‐free ZIMB is analyzed systematically through multiple ex situ characterizations and density functional theory (DFT) simulation. And the integrated sensing system illuminating for 12.0 h realizes the ultralong energy supply of the pressure sensor up to 150 000 cycles.

The HRI Conference is a highly selective international meeting showcasing the best research in human-robot interaction (HRI), with broad participation from various communities of scholars, including robotics, human-computer interaction, artificial intelligence, engineering, social and behavioral sciences, and design. The theme of this year's conference is \"Robots for Social Good,\" considering two trends that have shaped HRI-related technologies in the past year. One is that after many years of research, social robots are being finally introduced 'en masse' as consumer devices. And the second is a worldwide recognition, increasingly appreciated in the consumer software sector, that developers of new technologies need to be cognizant of the societal consequences of psychologically impactful devices. Balancing this societal and humanistic goal with the continuous evolution of technology, both in hardware and software, requires the multidisciplinary view that the HRI conference offers. To support this coming together of research areas, we solicited and reviewed papers under four submission themes: \"Human-Robot Interaction User Studies,\" \"Technical Advances in Human-Robot Interaction,\" \"Human-Robot Interaction Design,\" and \"Theory and Methods in Human-Robot Interaction.\" Each submission theme was overseen by a dedicated theme chair and reviewed by an expert group of program committee members, who worked together with the program chairs to define and apply review criteria appropriate to each of the four contribution types. The conference attracted 206 submissions from contributors worldwide, including countries from Asia-Pacific, Europe, the Middle East, and North America. Each full paper was aligned with a theme-appropriate subcommittee, and subsequently reviewed through a double-blind process, which was followed by a rebuttal phase, and shepherding where found appropriate by the program committee. Following the review process, the program committee selected 49 (23.8%) of the submissions for presentation as full papers at the conference. As the conference is jointly sponsored by IEEE and ACM, papers are archived in both the ACM Digital Library and the IEEE Xplore. This year, accommodating for the continued growth of the HRI conference, and with the goal of allowing for ample presentation, discussion, and informal meeting time, we have started to adopt a dual-track format for some of the full paper sessions. This also allowed us to plan for presenting papers from alternative tracks, such as alt HRI, and experiment with new presentation formats, under the principle of reevaluating our methods and processes, as appropriate for a conference covering a rapidly evolving field. Along with the full papers, the conference program and proceedings include Late Breaking Reports, Videos, Demos, and an alt.HRI section. Out of 137 total submissions, 123 (89.8%) Late Breaking Reports (LBRs) were accepted and will be presented as posters at the conference. A new peer-review process ensured that authors of LBR submissions received detailed feedback on their work. Fourteen short videos were accepted for presentation during a dedicated video session. The program also includes 9 demos of robot systems that participants will have an opportunity to interact with during the conference. We continue to include an alt.HRI session in this year's program, consisting of 5 papers (selected out of 14 submissions, 35.7%) that push the boundaries of thought and practice in the field. We are also continuing last year's reintroduction of the Student Design Competition event to encourage student participation in the conference and enrich the program with novel ideas and insights developed by student teams. The conference will also include 5 full-day and six half-day workshops on a wide array of topics. Finally, we have the pleasure of presenting three inspiring keynote speakers from both academia and industry, who represent well the multidisciplinary nature of the HRI conference: Prof. Kerstin Dautenhahn, a researcher of Artificial Intelligence from the School of Computer Science at the University of Hertfordshire in the UK, Dr. Steve Cousins, Founder and CEO of the service robotics company Savioke, and Prof. David Mindell, a researcher of History of Engineering and Manufacturing, and Professor of Aeronautics and Astronautics at MIT.", "abstract_source": "openalex", "authors": [], "publish_year": 2018, "venue": "", "citation_count": 33, "fields_of_study": ["Computer science", "Artificial intelligence", "Engineering ethics", "Engineering", "World Wide Web", "Psychology", "Sociology", "Social science", "Neuroscience"], "url": "https://openalex.org/W2912405302"}

{"source": "openalex", "paper_id": "https://openalex.org/W2172049598", "title": "Human–Robot Interaction", "abstract": "The field of human-robot interaction (HRI) addresses the design, understanding, and evaluation of robotic systems, which involve humans and robots interacting through communication. As the field matures, education of students becomes increasingly important. Courses in HRI provide the canonical set of knowledge and core skills that represent the current state of the field and permit the evolution of knowledge and methods to be transferred from research to a broad set of students. In addition, coursework in HRI creates a workforce capable of transferring HRI theory to practice. However, as would be expected with an emerging field, HRI courses are largely ad hoc. This article summarizes the discussion and findings from the \"Teaching Humans About Human-Robot Interaction\" workshop on the development of an HRI course for computer scientists and engineers.", "abstract_source": "openalex", "authors": ["Robin R.
